@0    = ~<CHARNAME>. Will you be going after those slavers?~ [lk#ar48]
@1    = ~I couldn't leave a job half-finished, could I?~
@2    = ~Another time, perhaps.~
@3    = ~I don't think so, no.~
@4    = ~If I remember correctly, there's a tunnel that runs directly from the Coronet to the main holding area. I remember seeing mention of it--~
@5    = ~Look, there's something I should tell you before we do this. I've got absolutely no links to it myself, I swear, but my father was the head of a slave syndicate in Athkatla.~
@6    = ~He died a few years ago, but I suspect we'll run into more than a few of those who worked with him. I'm just letting you know, they might recognize me.~
@7    = ~Thanks for telling me.~
@8    = ~You couldn't have told me earlier?~
@9    = ~In that case, it's too much of a risk to take you.~
@10   = ~I'd do it on my own, but somehow I don't think I'd be successful.~
@11   = ~You know they need to be taken out, and the sooner the better. The longer they're left to operate, the harder it will be. I'll be waiting here when you're ready.~
@12   = ~Great. Fantastic. So now they'll be able to strengthen their defenses, bring in more slaves, hire more guards...~
@13   = ~If you change your mind, I'll be waiting here.~
@14   = ~We should get going. The sooner we can get this done the better.~
@15   = ~"Oh, hi, I want your help in taking down some slavers! Oh, and by the way, my father was a slaver and that may complicate things more than a little." Yeah, I'm sure that would have gone down real well.~
@16   = ~I understand if you're apprehensive, but I can help you. I'm not some kid dreaming of adventure; I'm an experienced druid with more than a few tricks up his sleeve. You've seen what I can do. I can help you.~
@17   = ~I suppose you're right.~
@18   = ~Alright, but if you cause me any trouble, you're out, you understand?~
@19   = ~I don't need your help.~
@20   = ~Yeah, yeah, I get it.~
@21   = ~Fine. Well... best of luck, I suppose.~
@22   = ~Wait, just... I want to make sure as much of the trade is wiped out here as possible. I'm tired of seeing my father's shadow following me.~
@23   = ~I thought so. It just never ends, does it? You whack one slaver, and three more pop up...~
@24   = ~You lying bastard! Hendak, you'll not fight alone!~
@25   = ~I was just talking to a man named Arath in the back. He intends to free the slaves.~
@26   = ~That one gave me a bad taste in my mouth from the first... (hurrm...) Thank you. I will have the guards... take care of him.~
@27   = ~Here is some gold for your... (hurrrm) troubles.~
@28   = ~<CHARNAME>, what--come over here!~
@29   = ~What do you think you're doing?! We had an agreement!~
@30   = ~It was just a ruse to get the key to the cell, don't worry.~
@31   = ~I know what I'm doing.~
@32   = ~Agreements change.~
@33   = ~Oh. Well. In that case, let's go.~
@34   = ~You better, or there'll be trouble. And I don't mean the good kind.~
@35   = ~You bastard!~
@36   = ~Kill them, Tabitha!~
@37   = ~<CHARNAME>, the main building is through here.~
@38   = ~The last time I was here, I killed seven slavers and my father. I thought I'd taken out their main operation, but my father had laid plan after plan. I suppose his paranoia wouldn't allow anything else.~ [lk#ar49]
@39   = ~I don't know exactly what you should be expecting, but if it's anything like it was when my father was running things, they'll be formidable. Attack hard and fast.~
@40   = ~I'll keep that in mind.~
@41   = ~And which hand should I use to hold my sword, exactly?~
@42   = ~I know what to do. I've done this plenty of times before.~
@43   = ~You killed your own father?~
@44   = ~Don't ever tell me what to do.~
@45   = ~Let's go.~
@46   = ~I suppose this isn't your first rodeo, is it? I'm--not really used to working with a team.~
@47   = ~... I'll try to keep that in mind. No promises, though.~
@48   = ~I'll be right behind you. Just tell me where you want me and I'll do my best. Let's get these bastards.~
@49   = ~It's a little more complicated than that, but... essentially, yes.~
@50   = ~This used to be my father's room.~ [lk#ar50]
@51   = ~Are you alright?~
@52   = ~Yeah, yeah, and that's the table he used to work on, and that's the bed he used to sleep on...~
@53   = ~Enough about your father, already! Geez, don't you ever talk about anything else?~
@54   = ~Come on, let's get going.~
@55   = ~I swear, I'm not usually this...~
@56   = ~I didn't actually kill him. It was an infection, I think. I mean, I made the wound, but he musn't have cleaned it, or something must have got in there.~
@57   = ~Gods, this is a bizarre feeling. Alright. There are probably a few potions and such lying around, maybe a bit of gold. Grab those and let's finish this.~
@58   = ~Point taken.~
@59   = ~It's weird, I generally never talk about him. I barely think about it, usually.~
@60   = ~You! How dare you barge in here, attackin' my men left and right?! That's no way to treat an old friend, Arath!~
@61   = ~Shut your mouth, you bastard! How could you do this to these people?! And I'm no friend of yours!~
@62   = ~Nay? I seem to recall any number o' occasions chattin' about this 'n that under the watchful gaze o' yer good-for-nothing father, ye whoreson--~
@63   = ~Let these people go and we might kill you quickly!~
@64   = ~Haha! You think you can just sweep in here and order me around? Your father might've had command here once, but no longer!~
@65   = ~Let them go!~
@66   = ~So I guess it's over, then. Good to work with you, <CHARNAME>. I owe you a drink.~
@67   = ~I could use a drink.~
@68   = ~Thank you for your help.~
@69   = ~I have to go.~
@70   = ~Wait, before you do.~
@71   = ~A <PRO_MANWOMAN> after my own heart! Hendak? An ale for my friend here?~
@72   = ~Don't be stupid, you were the one helping me. Hendak! An ale for my friend here?~
@73   = ~They'll be back. Let's just hope Hendak is able to watch closely enough to catch them next time.~
@74   = ~And if he does, we'll be ready.~
@75   = ~You're on your own, next time.~
@76   = ~Thanks for the ale.~
@77   = ~We got paid, that's the important part.~
@78   = ~Look, I've been thinking.~
@79   = ~Well, actually I'm sort of hoping I won't be.~
@80   = ~Thank our foreign friend over there, not me.~
@81   = ~Heh, that we did, and gold is its own reward, right? There's enough there to pay for at least a few nights with one of the girls in the back there.~
@82   = ~Or boys, I don't judge. Not that you need to pay for companionship, I'm sure you can get that easily enough on your own. (grin)~
@83   = ~Heh, that we did, and gold is its own reward, right? There's enough there to pay for at least a few nights with one of the guys in the back there.~
@84   = ~Or girls, I don't judge. Not that you need to pay for companionship, I'm sure you can get that easily enough on your own. (grin)~
@85   = ~I don't have anything planned after this. Beyond getting a bit drunk and having some fun with someone out the back, I mean.~
@86   = ~You never mentioned what, exactly, you were doing.~
@87   = ~I'm raising money to rescue my foster-sister, who was kidnapped by an evil mage.~
@88   = ~I'm trying to track down the bastard who kidnapped and tortured me and my foster-sister.~
@89   = ~And I have no intention to.~
@90   = ~Are you trying to ask me if you can join me permanently?~
@91   = ~That sounds a little complicated, what you've got to do there.~
@92   = ~I guess that's fair. I just wanted to ask... well--~
@93   = ~Were you, ah. Perhaps you might be needing some help? I come with quite the list of accomplishments. Took down this slaver ring once with some nobody off the street.~
@94   = ~It just so happens that I might need some help, yes. You wouldn't happen to be interested, would you?~
@95   = ~That 'nobody' is actually the Savior of the Sword Coast, and I'd be happy to have your help.~
@96   = ~On the Sword Coast I'm regarded as something of a hero. And no, I don't need your help.~
@97   = ~I would love to have your help, but I've already promised the position to someone else.~
@98   = ~Hells no. There is no way I am going to voluntarily put up with your whining permanently.~
@99   = ~Being as busy as I am, well, I'll have to think about it. Check my diary, ask my assistant, that kind of thing.~
@100  = ~Are we staying anywhere? Because I'm famished... could really use a good meal. Somewhere with beds, I hope. And hot water. Mmm...~
@101  = ~Really? I didn't know that.~
@102  = ~Well, let's get going! Are we staying anywhere? Because I'm famished... could really use a good meal. Somewhere with beds, I hope. And hot water. Mmm...~
@103  = ~Really? I didn't know that. And here I could have been hero-worshipping you this whole time! Dang, what a shame.~
@104  = ~Ah. Well. Alright. I'm sure they'll be... adequate.~
@105  = ~No need to be rude there, adventure<PRO_GIRLBOY>!~
@106  = ~I'll be around if you ever need an extra hand.~
@107  = ~There's a certain weird beauty to these caverns. I'd never have thought such enormous spaces lay beneath our feet as we walked, but... Here you go. Even the drow themselves have a sort of terrifying, brutal beauty.~
@108  = ~I'd have to agree. They do have a certain charm.~
@109  = ~I don't really care what they look like, I'm more concerned with getting out of them.~
@110  = ~I don't think they really compare to you, but I suppose.~
@111  = ~How could you say that? It's disgusting down here.~
@112  = ~I'm sorry, did you say something?~
@113  = ~You've got a point there. I already miss the sky overhead and the grass beneath my feet.~
@114  = ~I've never thought of myself as brutally beautiful before, but I suppose? (grin)~
@115  = ~I disagree. I think there's something enchanting about the glowing mushrooms, at least. Some of the stone structures are pretty amazing, too.~
@116  = ~Don't worry about it.~
@117  = ~I have to admit, I've never really given thought to what the Underdark might be like. It's never exactly kept me up at night. I knew the drow and duergar lived underground, of course, but I never imagined I'd see either of them myself, let alone walk through a drow city.~
@118  = ~Despite the circumstances, we are lucky to have experienced something few others have.~
@119  = ~Enough gawking. Let's focus on getting out of here.~
@120  = ~I never thought about it, and I wish I never had to.~
@121  = ~There are few things that keep you up at night, in my experience, Arath.~
@122  = ~We're lucky for a lot of things.~
@123  = ~Really? That surprises me. Maybe it shouldn't.~
@124  = ~What's that supposed to mean? There are plenty of things that keep me up at night. Most of them involve sharing a bedroll, I'll admit, but now's not the time for that.~
@125  = ~I'd just--I hadn't thought about it.~
@126  = ~I suppose there's a lot of things I haven't really thought about.~
@127  = ~Some of these trees must be thousands of years old...~
@128  = ~Beautiful, isn't it?~
@129  = ~Yes, let's all stand and admire the trees. Look, they even have bark!~
@130  = ~They make me feel so small.~
@131  = ~Must we stop at everything natural we come across?~
@132  = ~It is.~
@133  = ~Some even have leaves, I know! Shocking.~
@134  = ~Nature has a way of doing that to people, I've noticed.~
@135  = ~I don't stop at--~
@136  = ~Alright, fine, but how can you stand there and be so uninterested when you're standing in a forest that has been untouched since the dawn of time?~
@137  = ~I'm glad we got to come here. I've missed this.~
@138  = ~You don't get to see this every day, that's for sure.~
@139  = ~You're adorable when you're like this.~
@140  = ~I'm sorry?~
@141  = ~Care to come back and join us in the real world?~
@142  = ~I wish we did, though.~
@143  = ~I'm adorable the vast majority of the time, I'll have you know. No need to be so rude.~
@144  = ~Being around so much nature. There's something special about places like this, <CHARNAME>. Can't you feel it?~
@145  = ~This *is* the real world. About as real as you're going to get.~
@146  = ~This reminds me of why I wanted to become a druid in the first place. This feeling of... I don't know. "Wonderment" seems like such a boring way to put it.~
@147  = ~Wonder sounds like a fairly good description to me.~
@148  = ~They're just trees, Arath. They're for making chairs and tables.~
@149  = ~I just feel a little bemused at how ridiculous you are.~
@150  = ~Personally I'd go for "boring," but that's just me.~
@151  = ~Yeah. Yeah, it is.~
@152  = ~If you chop down these trees for timber, I swear, I'd probably chop you down right after. These trees are alive in a way most people don't understand.~
@153  = ~I'm glad I could entertain you.~
@154  = ~Sometimes I wonder about you, <CHARNAME>. Really.~
@155  = ~Well, while we're here I may as well stock up on ingredients.~
@156  = ~Ooh, is that a lantern beetle? I haven't seen one of those for months!~
@157  = ~I don't mean to interrupt your dragon-killing rampage there, crazy <PRO_MANWOMAN>, but I just wanted to say that it's a good cause we're fighting for, and to... keep it up.~
@158  = ~And what cause would that be, exactly?~
@159  = ~That was quite possibly the most bizarre compliment I've ever received.~
@160  = ~Oh, don't worry. I will.~
@161  = ~Isn't it your job to... uh, "keep it up?"~
@162  = ~You're damn right it's a good cause.~
@163  = ~I hadn't finished my dragon-killing rampage, you know.~
@164  = ~Do we have to do this right now?~
@165  = ~Hey, I'm trying to be serious here.~
@166  = ~My, <CHARNAME>, is it hot out here or is it just me?~
@167  = ~Hush and stop distracting me. I'm trying to be serious here.~
@168  = ~And usually I'd be the first to do so, vixen, but I'm trying to be serious here.~
@169  = ~And while I'd usually be the first one to acknowledge that, I'm trying to be serious here.~
@170  = ~I'm trying to say something nice. Shut up and let me finish.~
@171  = ~Suldanessellar. The forest. Your soul. Stopping Irenicus.~
@172  = ~They're all good causes. I'm glad I've had the opportunity to help fight for them, and I suppose I have you to thank for dragging me through this, so, uh... thanks.~
@173  = ~(Kiss him.)~
@174  = ~That's me, here to help!~
@175  = ~It's really me who should be thanking you.~
@176  = ~It really was dragging, I assure you.~
@177  = ~Okay, I get it. Can we go now?~
@178  = ~Mm.. that was nice. You should do that more often.~
@179  = ~Wait, what was I saying?~
@180  = ~Here to help and bother me endlessly, sure. (grin)~
@181  = ~Come to think of it, you've got a point there. Where's my thank you?~
@182  = ~(Hug him.)~
@183  = ~Thank you, Arath. I appreciate everything you've done for me.~
@184  = ~Thank you for being an enormous pain in the rear.~
@185  = ~Nice try.~
@186  = ~Well if you're going to have that attitude about it, absolutely, there's going to be dragging involved, and a fair bit of alcohol.~
@187  = ~Yes, I'm sure there are plenty more enormous, frightening monsters to kill. Come on, we've got a city to save and a wizard to punish.~
@188  = ~Now, aren't there more enormous, frightening monsters we have to kill? Come on, we've got a city to save and a wizard to punish.~
@189  = ~It was worth a shot. (wink)~
@190  = ~My pleasure, as always. (wink)~
@191  = ~There, was that so difficult? (grin)~
@192  = ~So what next? Now that we've got one dragon down, I was thinking we could take on a demigod or something, what do you think?~
@193  = ~I've always had a dislike for demigods. I think you're on to something.~
@194  = ~Give me a moment while I search for something with which to deflate your enormous ego.~
@195  = ~Dragonblood is a good look for you. You should wear it more often.~
@196  = ~I've defeated worse before.~
@197  = ~We just need to find one, and we'll be all set. Know where the deities spend their time these days?~
@198  = ~Give me a break. We did just conquer a ferocious, bloodthirsty, revenge-bent red dragon. I think I'm entitled to a little self-congratulation.~
@199  = ~(grin) You think? You don't look so bad yourself.~
@200  = ~Of course you have, my <PRO_LADYLORD> <CHARNAME>. But for those of us who haven't saved the Sword Coast from ruination, I think we can spare a little self-congratulation.~
@201  = ~He doesn't look so intimidating now. Actually, he doesn't seem terribly impressive at all.~
@202  = ~They never do.~
@203  = ~Oh, I don't know. I think he'll make a pretty impressive set of armor.~
@204  = ~Dragons talk big, but in the end, they fall just as hard as anything else.~
@205  = ~He wasn't impressive to begin with.~
@206  = ~Just looks kind of... well. Dead. Gods.~
@207  = ~I think he will, at that.~
@208  = ~I swear I felt the ground shake when he came down. I've never seen anything so big. Gods.~
@209  = ~Maybe not to you, but some of us have never faced off a dragon before, so have a little patience.~
@210  = ~Sort of makes all my problems look rather insignificant.~
@211  = ~We just took down a *dragon*, <CHARNAME>.~
@212  = ~We might even be able to do this. Get the girl, and the wizard. We can do this.~
@213  = ~We might even be able to do this. We'll get that bastard, and we'll get your soul back. We can do this.~
@214  = ~We can do this.~
@215  = ~...ugh. What happened? Where am I?~
@216  = ~You died. In rather spectacular fashion, I might add.~
@217  = ~You've managed to outdo yourself, and completely fail at life.~
@218  = ~Welcome back.~
@219  = ~Get up, you idiot. And be more careful next time.~
@220  = ~I guess that would explain this massive headache, and why I ache in places I don't generally ache.~
@221  = ~I... what?~
@222  = ~Oh gods, I died, didn't I?~
@223  = ~You did indeed.~
@224  = ~It was very dramatic.~
@225  = ~Come on, get up.~
@226  = ~Next time I won't be so generous.~
@227  = ~I would hope so. I really died?~
@228  = ~Hold your horses. I really died?~
@229  = ~Well, thanks. I'd really prefer not to... I was really dead?~
@230  = ~Wait, I'm not--undead, am I? Because then I'd have to kill myself, and I'd really prefer to avoid that.~
@231  = ~At least your humor is still there.~
@232  = ~You're alive, don't worry.~
@233  = ~Well, at least I know what to do next time.~
@234  = ~I'm fine, just... sore. Alright, let's get going.~
@235  = ~Good.~
@236  = ~You wouldn't. Would you? (groan)~
@237  = ~I need a drink.~
@238  = ~...it happened again, didn't it? I died? I'm never going to get used to this. (wince)~
@239  = ~It does get easier.~
@240  = ~Bring anything back for me?~
@241  = ~Stop whining, we need to go.~
@242  = ~I don't get a thank you?~
@243  = ~Gods, I hope so. Alright, let's go.~
@244  = ~The gods say hello, and Ao asked me to get your recipe for roast chicken. Apparently it's notorious even amongst deities.~
@245  = ~Alright, let's get going.~
@246  = ~Alright, give me a hand. Let's go.~
@247  = ~...thank you. That done, let's get going.~
@248  = ~Woah... okay, let's go in a minute. Just give me a second. Is everything spinning for you? Everything's spinning for me.~
@249  = ~I'll just... wait here for a moment. You go. I'll catch up.~
@250  = ~Ugh, I think I'm going to be sick...~
@251  = ~This is everything wrong with civilization, right here.~
@252  = ~What do you mean?~
@253  = ~What on Faerun are you talking about?~
@254  = ~You mean that adorable monkey?~
@255  = ~There are many things wrong with civilization.~
@256  = ~Could you, for once, keep your opinions to yourself?~
@257  = ~Over there. The animals.~
@258  = ~Yes. No. The fact that the adorable monkey has a chain around its leg!~
@259  = ~Yes, there are. But this... it symbolizes everything negative about it.~
@260  = ~Fine.~
@261  = ~I like a good circus as much as the next man, but this? Caging animals for entertainment? Forcing them to perform for gawking spectactors without a brain in their heads?~
@262  = ~This is just wrong.~
@263  = ~It is absolutely wrong, and someone should do something about it.~
@264  = ~It is. And there's nothing we can do about it.~
@265  = ~I've never really thought about it that way.~
@266  = ~I don't know, there's a certain toothless charm to a caged tiger. Nothing quite like making nature bow down before you.~
@267  = ~Don't think I haven't strongly considered it.~
@268  = ~You think I don't know that?~
@269  = ~I know we can't do anything. That's what makes me angry.~
@270  = ~Few do. That's what makes me so angry.~
@271  = ~You might be joking, but I'm going to pretend you didn't just say that. Because if you did, I'd be obligated to cut you down where you stand, and there are witnesses.~
@272  = ~Why do people feel the need to tame nature? Why can't they admire the lion from afar, instead of muzzling him and putting him behind bars? The sheer audacity of these people astounds me.~
@273  = ~I ought to let the animals out right here... Those idiots deserve to be mauled.~
@274  = ~If you get the keys, I'll hold off the guards.~
@275  = ~These people might be ignorant, but that doesn't mean they deserve to be mauled. They need to be educated.~
@276  = ~You're terribly attractive when you're angry. Did you know that?~
@277  = ~I can maul them for you, if you'd like.~
@278  = ~Does it really matter?~
@279  = ~I won't say I'm not tempted, but we can't. And even if we did, they'd replace them within six months anyway. (sigh)~
@280  = ~You're right. I know.~
@281  = ~It just... this gets to me. I feel so helpless.~
@282  = ~I--~
@283  = ~What? <CHARNAME>, that's nice, but this really isn't the time.~
@284  = ~I won't say I'm not tempted. I just... I just feel so helpless.~
@285  = ~Yes, it matters! Is something wrong with you? These poor creatures are being subjected to a life so confined and limited I doubt they would even remember how to survive on their own! You don't see anything wrong with that?~
@286  = ~Let's just go. I don't want to talk about this.~
@287  = ~Let's go before I change my mind and decide to do the right thing.~
@288  = ~(sigh)~
@289  = ~Copper for your thoughts?~
@290  = ~What're you sighing about?~
@291  = ~Do you really have to brood quite so loudly?~
@292  = ~(Ignore him.)~
@293  = ~Hmm?~
@294  = ~I'm just feeling a bit conflicted. I'm not sure what to think.~
@295  = ~What about, exactly?~
@296  = ~That cloak doesn't go with those shoes.~
@297  = ~I'm listening.~
@298  = ~I don't have time for this.~
@299  = ~What?~
@300  = ~Oh, very funny. Well, it's become clear to me you have very little taste, so I'm going to ignore that.~
@301  = ~I'm just thinking about Lavok.~
@302  = ~Lavok and the Planar Sphere. Well, more... Lavok's death. He deserved to die for the unnatural horrors he perpetrated, for his crimes against nature.~
@303  = ~I'm just struggling to reconcile the idea and the man.~
@304  = ~The idea and the man?~
@305  = ~I know what you mean.~
@306  = ~As usual, you make very little sense.~
@307  = ~I don't believe in instant redemption. I still believe what he did was wrong, and that he needed to die. And yet... there was more to it than that. It wasn't that simple.~
@308  = ~Nothing is ever that simple, Arath. There are so many shades of gray, it's a wonder anyone can distinguish what's right and what's wrong at all.~
@309  = ~He died for the evils he did, yes. But in death there can be redemption.~
@310  = ~He fought the evil that was inside of him, and he died on his own terms. There's something honorable about that.~
@311  = ~You don't get redemption after the sort of things he did.~
@312  = ~Why do you care, exactly? He fought us, he died, big deal.~
@313  = ~There's nothing but shades of gray. You know I don't believe in good and evil, but... what he did went against everything I stand for. Still...~
@314  = ~Maybe. You know I don't believe in good and evil, but... what he did went against everything I stand for. Still...~
@315  = ~No, you don't. Still...~
@316  = ~I'm not sure. What he did goes against everything I stand for, but still...~
@317  = ~He asked that his body be taken outside, so he could feel the sun again.~
@318  = ~I don't know what to think.~
@319  = ~There is something dreadfully wrong with this forest.~
@320  = ~I know.~
@321  = ~You don't say?~
@322  = ~What's wrong with it, do you think?~
@323  = ~Less talking, more investigating.~
@324  = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@325  = ~I don't know.~
@326  = ~Everything just looks... I don't know. The trees have an unnatural pallor I've never seen before. Even the light seems wrong.~
@327  = ~The whole forest is filled with shadows. It's dying.~
@328  = ~Whatever it is, we're going to fix it.~
@329  = ~Do you enjoy stating the obvious, or are you just stupid?~
@330  = ~Then let's find out what's wrong.~
@331  = ~I don't know what would have given *that* away...~
@332  = ~We've got to do it soon. I think the... corruption, or whatever it is, it's getting worse.~
@333  = ~Do you mind? This is more important than your bloody insults.~
@334  = ~Then let's do it quickly. I think the... corruption, or whatever it is, it's getting worse.~
@335  = ~We have to fix this, and we have to do it soon. I think the... corruption, or whatever it is, it's getting worse.~
@336  = ~You can't be serious about this. We're going to work with *vampires*? Are you out of your mind?~
@337  = ~Quite possibly. Crazy people don't know they're crazy, do they?~
@338  = ~I'm deadly serious. It's the best option.~
@339  = ~I don't like it either.~
@340  = ~And what exactly is wrong with vampires?~
@341  = ~If you've got a problem with it, you're free to leave.~
@342  = ~Then why in the nine hells are you agreeing to this?~
@343  = ~Is there something wrong with you? Vampires are merciless fiends, with no place in the natural order. They should not exist!~
@344  = ~I suppose this is goodbye, then. I hope once they've used you for whatever it is they need that they kill you quickly.~
@345  = ~We should be driving stakes into their unnatural hearts, not furthering their cause and taking out their enemies!~
@346  = ~I don't intend on furthering their cause any more than I have to. But right now I need them in order to rescue Imoen.~
@347  = ~I need them right now, but when I have Imoen back, rest assured that we will return and destroy them.~
@348  = ~You have to understand, Arath, this is my sister. I'll do whatever I have to.~
@349  = ~They're just trying to get by in this world, just like everyone else. I don't have a problem with helping them.~
@350  = ~So you're willing to consort with vampires and the undead in order to get her back? Is she really worth that much to you?~
@351  = ~Yes. She's my sister.~
@352  = ~She means everything to me.~
@353  = ~We've been together since childhood. I have to rescue her.~
@354  = ~In all honesty, I don't care for her much, but all the same... I have to rescue her.~
@355  = ~Then I can't stay with you any longer. I refuse to do dirty work for those filth.~
@356  = ~We have to work with them, Arath. It's our best option.~
@357  = ~It's my sister. I have to get her back.~
@358  = ~That's your prerogative.~
@359  = ~I suppose if I was in your position... I don't know what I'd do.~
@360  = ~Promise me this, then. When we have Imoen, will we come back and wipe these aberrations from the face of Toril?~
@361  = ~I swear.~
@362  = ~I'll take a geas if you want me to.~
@363  = ~I can't do that. I don't know what will happen.~
@364  = ~I will promise no such thing.~
@365  = ~If you're lying to me, <CHARNAME>, I swear by every god, human and otherwise, that I will do everything in my power to end you. These bloodsucking fiends deserve no mercy, and if you don't go through with this, neither will you.~
@366  = ~Understood.~
@367  = ~Tetchy, aren't you?~
@368  = ~I've already agreed, you don't need to threaten me.~
@369  = ~I don't take kindly to threats.~
@370  = ~I won't make you swear a geas, but...~
@371  = ~The undead deserve no place in this world. They are enemies of all that is natural, and they cannot be allowed to live long.~
@372  = ~I hope the chance to end them comes sooner rather than later.~
@373  = ~I don't have a problem with thieves, <CHARNAME>--well, as long as they don't steal from me--but are you sure it's wise to throw in our lot with the Shadow Thieves? They're not exactly known as the most trustworthy of organizations, to say the least. And they've already taken our money.~
@374  = ~I don't think we have much choice.~
@375  = ~At least we know we're in for more exciting backstabbing, right?~
@376  = ~It's my choice to make.~
@377  = ~I'd just like to point out that your opinion means really very little to me.~
@378  = ~You may be right.~
@379  = ~That's what I'm worried about.~
@380  = ~I'm not saying that it isn't.~
@381  = ~I just hope you're making the right decision. My father had dealings with the Shadow Thieves. They might have the connections to get us where we need to go, but...~
@382  = ~I just hope you're right.~
@383  = ~When have I ever led us wrong?~
@384  = ~You're not the only one.~
@385  = ~I don't appreciate your lack of faith.~
@386  = ~I suppose we'll see.~
@387  = ~Oh, come on, now you're just asking for trouble.~
@388  = ~I'm trusting you, so this better not blow up in our faces. Come on.~
@389  = ~<CHARNAME>... what happened? What did he do to you?~
@390  = ~He said he took my soul.~
@391  = ~The bastard stole my soul.~
@392  = ~He found a way to... to take my soul.~
@393  = ~I'm too tired for this, Arath.~
@394  = ~The others are saying... they're saying he took your soul. Is it true?~
@395  = ~How is that even possible?~
@396  = ~I'm not sure.~
@397  = ~He had some kind of machine.~
@398  = ~Some sort of death spell; many others died in the process.~
@399  = ~He took Imoen's, as well. That's why she's not... herself.~
@400  = ~He... took your soul? How is that even possible?~
@401  = ~This sounds like something out of one of those stories you get told as a child. Surely you can't just... *lose* your soul like that. What's going to happen to you? Will you be alright?~
@402  = ~I really don't know, Arath.~
@403  = ~Without my soul... I'm worried about the Bhaal essence.~
@404  = ~I'll be fine as soon as I kill him and get it back.~
@405  = ~Would you stop questioning me? I've got enough to deal with!~
@406  = ~Gods... I hadn't thought. <CHARNAME>...~
@407  = ~We'll get it back, <CHARNAME>. We'll fix this. And we'll make him pay.~
@408  = ~Well, we're now officially involved in fishy politics.~
@409  = ~And it's really starting to get murky!~
@410  = ~...that's honestly one of the worst jokes I've ever heard.~
@411  = ~(groan) Did you have to? Really?~
@412  = ~One more bad joke and I'm leaving you here. I'm not joking.~
@413  = ~My joke was funny. That was just... murky? That was the best you could come up with?~
@414  = ~And here I had high hopes for you, <CHARNAME>. You disappoint me.~
@415  = ~I do my best. (wink)~
@416  = ~Alright, alright! Geez. No need to glare at me.~
@417  = ~You know, it's a little bizarre how wherever we go, you find some way to get us involved in a problem. People just seem to gravitate towards you. It's like you have this aura of, "come to me, my children, and I shall fix that which is broken, solve that which is unsolvable and speak with the unspeakable!"~
@418  = ~I don't mind. Gives me a chance to right some wrongs, and that's never a bad thing.~
@419  = ~It really is a gift.~
@420  = ~I wish they'd find someone else to fix their bloody problems. It's not like I haven't got enough to do.~
@421  = ~I couldn't care less what they want, as long as I get paid.~
@422  = ~Well, I'm glad you feel that way. I think in your shoes I'd be getting a little tetchy. Then again, I wouldn't be in your shoes, but let's not get into that.~
@423  = ~Seems that way.~
@424  = ~You're just too approachable. You should work on that... take some tips from Irenicus. He's got intimidating downpat.~
@425  = ~And that's the <CHARNAME> we know and love!~
@426  = ~For the record, I could care less what happens here. But it doesn't sound like we've heard the whole story... we should go speak with the Priestess.~
@427  = ~Really, I don't know how you get us into these things. You've got a talent, my friend.~
@428  = ~Before we go in to the grove, <CHARNAME>, I've heard of these Shadow Druids. They're a militant group who defend the Mother by any means necessary, to the death if need be. They will not be swayed by words, only action.~
@429  = ~<CHARNAME>, their methods might be extreme, but I can't say I disagree with their aims.~
@430  = ~What are their aims, exactly?~
@431  = ~I've heard of them, too. They attack innocent towns for "encroaching," and steal the children.~
@432  = ~Damn right their methods are extreme. Care to explain yourself?~
@433  = ~Attack first, ask questions later. Got it. I don't need to hear the rest.~
@434  = ~They believe in the sanctity of nature above all else, and devote their lives to defending her. Yes, they do have extreme methods, and I'm not saying I agree with everything they do, but there's something admirable about their devotion.~
@435  = ~I'm not sure what it is, but... it's there.~
@436  = ~There is something admirable about defending what you believe in, I suppose.~
@437  = ~Maybe you have a point. But if they attack me, I'm fighting back.~
@438  = ~There is nothing admirable about what the Shadow Druids do.~
@439  = ~I don't care about their intentions, all I care about is getting paid.~
@440  = ~I could care more about what they believe, I'm taking them out.~
@441  = ~All I'm saying is, hear them out. Some factions are less extreme than others, and they're fighting an important battle. Don't not listen to what they're saying just because you don't agree with their methods.~
@442  = ~They just do it with a bit more, uh, conviction than some others is all. I'm not saying I agree with the child-stealing or the attacking innocents policies.~
@443  = ~Well. That didn't go how I was expecting it to.~
@444  = ~Are you alright? You look a little shaken.~
@445  = ~Nothing ever goes how we expect it to. It's some kind of law, I think.~
@446  = ~They were crazy, we killed them. End of story.~
@447  = ~I'm not your confidante. Go whine to someone else.~
@448  = ~I'm alright, just a little surprised is all.~
@449  = ~I've heard that, too. Always seems that way.~
@450  = ~I didn't think you were my confidante, dearest <CHARNAME>, I just wanted to say that maybe I was wrong. That's all.~
@451  = ~To be honest, I'd never met a Shadow Druid before, only heard about them. I didn't think they'd be so...~
@452  = ~Insane?~
@453  = ~Brutal?~
@454  = ~Violent?~
@455  = ~Uncompromising?~
@456  = ~Sexy?~
@457  = ~Well... yeah.~
@458  = ~Yes, but...~
@459  = ~Uncompromising, absolutely, but...~
@460  = ~I don't know, some of those younger men were pretty fine, made me feel awful for having to kill them. (grin)~
@461  = ~But... no.~
@462  = ~They were hurting nature in an attempt to defend it. I just... I can't wrap my head around that. How on Toril do they justify that?~
@463  = ~Crazy people don't need justification for their actions, Arath.~
@464  = ~They justify it by saying that they're doing what they have to. They obviously saw no other option.~
@465  = ~Some people are power-hungry, and will do whatever needs to be done to attain that power.~
@466  = ~They can't justify it.~
@467  = ~Does anyone really care?~
@468  = ~I suppose not, no.~
@469  = ~Maybe that's how they justified it, but they were wrong. There are always other ways than hurting what you're trying to protect.~
@470  = ~I hadn't really thought of them as power-hungry before. I guess that makes sense.~
@471  = ~No. They can't. (sigh)~
@472  = ~Maybe, maybe not. Let's get back to Trademeet and tell Lord Coprith his problems are over.~
@473  = ~Maybe I was... wrong. I'll admit that.~
@474  = ~Let's return to Trademeet and tell Lord Coprith his problems are over.~
@475  = ~Remind me why we're helping the de'Arnise family again?~
@476  = ~It just seems a little pointless. I know they need help, but there are others who could do it, and we've got no reason to.~
@477  = ~We're not righting some cosmic wrong, getting revenge, or... any other reason, really. Why're we doing this?~
@478  = ~Because it's the right thing to do.~
@479  = ~Helping people in need is important.~
@480  = ~Whim, mainly. I felt like helping, so I did.~
@481  = ~You realise there will be a reward at the end of this?~
@482  = ~Because we are. I don't have to share my reasoning.~
@483  = ~It depends on whose viewpoint you're looking at things.~
@484  = ~Is it?~
@485  = ~I suppose I can understand that, being fairly whim-oriented myself, but... I don't know.~
@486  = ~Well, yes, I do. But if we wanted money we could steal from the upper class Athkatlans.~
@487  = ~That's your prerogative, I suppose.~
@488  = ~Sometimes I just struggle a little with why we do some things. It's all well and good to help people, but there's no real reason to, unless there's something really wrong that needs to be fixed.~
@489  = ~I can understand clearing a temple of undead; they're unnatural fiends and need to be killed. I can understand returning a lost child to her mother, and I can even understand revenge on someone else's behalf.~
@490  = ~This whole... helping people just because they need help is a little foreign to me is all. I don't see the point.~
@491  = ~Helping others is a large part of being a good person.~
@492  = ~For me, helping people is an important part of my faith.~
@493  = ~Like I said, I'm in it for the reward. I couldn't care less about helping people.~
@494  = ~A lot of things are foreign to you, Arath. It doesn't mean they're bad.~
@495  = ~Your definition of what's 'helping people' and what isn't is more than a little blurry.~
@496  = ~I'm just doing whatever I can to raise money.~
@497  = ~I guess I just don't see the lure of trying to be 'good'.~
@498  = ~I don't have a problem with that. I guess I just don't understand the desire some people have to try to be 'good'.~
@499  = ~I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I guess I just don't understand the desire some people have to try to be 'good'.~
@500  = ~It makes perfect sense to me, but then, a lot of things make sense to me that... don't really make sense. I guess I just don't understand the desire some people have to try to be 'good'.~
@501  = ~Yeah. I know.~
@502  = ~I guess I just don't understand the desire some people have to try to be 'good'.~
@503  = ~Then again, I don't really understand the desire to be 'evil' either, though I don't think anyone really does. Except maybe small children. I'm fairly sure they're the main exception to that rule.~
@504  = ~It may have taken a while, but I'm glad we got to take out that coven. Bodhi was indescribably creepy, on so many levels. I really don't understand what was with that jacket, especially. Was she trying to accentuate her cold, bloodless boobs?~
@505  = ~Do you mind? I just had to kill my lover, you insensitive jerk!~
@506  = ~I noticed that vampires tend to play up their sexuality. I suppose it gives them a better chance of luring victims.~
@507  = ~Even the male vampires were dressed... uh. Interestingly.~
@508  = ~I'm just glad it's over.~
@509  = ~I'm just glad it's over, and that Imoen has her soul back.~
@510  = ~Must you always be so flippant?~
@511  = ~I didn't mind the accentuating.~
@512  = ~I really don't understand your need to talk about every little thing.~
@513  = ~Strangely, I just couldn't bring myself to find it attractive. They just looked so... I don't know. Overly done up?~
@514  = ~You can say that again.~
@515  = ~And why shouldn't I be? We just almost single-handedly wiped out an entire coven of vampires. A little flippancy is exactly what's needed, I think.~
@516  = ~Well, *you* wouldn't. You do have to remember that some of us have taste, <CHARNAME>.~
@517  = ~It's a reflex.~
@518  = ~They certainly had a flair for interesting decor, though, don't you think? The pools of blood and satin cushions were a nice touch, I thought.~
@519  = ~The room filled with spikes was a highlight for me personally.~
@520  = ~Hey, I thought those cushions were pretty nice. I would have taken some if it weren't for the bloodstains.~
@521  = ~When I get a home, I'm thinking of getting the same interior designer, actually.~
@522  = ~Is something wrong with you? It was disgusting.~
@523  = ~Get to the point, Arath.~
@524  = ~Right. It's a reflex. Sorry.~
@525  = ~It did have a certain, uh, attraction.~
@526  = ~Don't think I didn't notice that.~
@527  = ~I'm not sure anyone's had any success bringing the undead back from the dead, but hey, I'm willing to give it a shot just to see that.~
@528  = ~There are many things wrong with me, dear <CHARNAME>. This is the least of them. (grin)~
@529  = ~Anyway, I just wanted to say... I'm glad you kept your word. I didn't really want to have to kill you. For one, I'd probably lose, so there's that.~
@530  = ~And look what it got me. The body of my vampirized lover, who I don't even know I can bring back.~
@531  = ~Of course I kept my word. I hate vampires as much as you do.~
@532  = ~You would have lost, yes.~
@533  = ~I do have a certain obligation to kill undead, you know.~
@534  = ~It isn't like I had any choice. They had to be taken out.~
@535  = ~Is it so difficult for you to say thank you?~
@536  = ~I know. We'll do everything we can, don't worry.~
@537  = ~It still means a lot.~
@538  = ~Yes. Yes, it is. Come on.~
@539  = ~We'll fix this.~
@540  = ~Well on that life-affirming note, shall we continue?~
@541  = ~Can we talk?~
@542  = ~Away from the others?~
@543  = ~Of course. What's the matter?~
@544  = ~What is it now?~
@545  = ~Is something wrong?~
@546  = ~I'm busy right now.~
@547  = ~I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.~
@548  = ~Look, I've been hearing something recently. I'm not sure what it means, exactly, but...~
@549  = ~<CHARNAME>, what exactly is a Bhaalspawn?~
@550  = ~Ah. I was wondering when we were going to get to that.~
@551  = ~It means a person with the blood of the dead god Bhaal running through their veins.~
@552  = ~(sigh) Can we talk about something else?~
@553  = ~You can take a minute.~
@554  = ~What does it mean, <CHARNAME>?~
@555  = ~Before the Time of Troubles, the god Bhaal foresaw his own death. In order to ensure he would rise again, he spawned a score of mortal progeny. From the Prophecies of Alaundo.~
@556  = ~Bhaalspawn are the children of the dead god of murder, Bhaal.~
@557  = ~Some dead god had sex with a bunch of women and then died.~
@558  = ~A person with the...~
@559  = ~We do.~
@560  = ~Well. That is... not what I was expecting.~
@561  = ~Gods, <CHARNAME>. Are you...~
@562  = ~I am a Bhaalspawn, if that's what you're asking.~
@563  = ~Yes, I am in fact a Chinchilla.~
@564  = ~Do you have to ask?~
@565  = ~No, I'm a wild water caribou. Idiot.~
@566  = ~You really have a way with words, you know.~
@567  = ~Okay.~
@568  = ~Yes, because you look fluffy and soft and cuddly and--~
@569  = ~I really do.~
@570  = ~I think I'd prefer that to--~
@571  = ~I need to--~
@572  = ~I just need to have a think. I have to go.~
@573  = ~You were born this way, right?~
@574  = ~Born what way?~
@575  = ~You mean, was I born a Bhaalspawn?~
@576  = ~Leave me alone, Arath.~
@577  = ~You were born a Bhaalspawn?~
@578  = ~Yes, I was.~
@579  = ~No, I woke up one day and bam, there it was!~
@580  = ~Of course I was, you idiot. It's not a disease.~
@581  = ~... yeah.~
@582  = ~Alright.~
@583  = ~You didn't seek it out, or anything like that?~
@584  = ~No! I didn't!~
@585  = ~No, of course not. Arath, what are you getting at?~
@586  = ~This questioning is getting tedious, Arath.~
@587  = ~I would have if it were possible.~
@588  = ~This isn't something that I wanted, if that's what you mean.~
@589  = ~I'm just a bit uncertain about this whole thing. It feels... wrong. It is wrong. It goes against everything natural, everything I stand for.~
@590  = ~I just don't know how to deal with it, exactly.~
@591  = ~I've found it helps if you just don't think about it too much.~
@592  = ~You get used to the idea.~
@593  = ~I don't *want* to be this way.~
@594  = ~I'm a Bhaalspawn, and that's something you're just going to have to accept.~
@595  = ~You can start by not interrogating me.~
@596  = ~Well, that doesn't surprise me.~
@597  = ~Well, yeah.~
@598  = ~Great advice, there. I'll have to remember that.~
@599  = ~I don't know if I'd go that far. It's a big sort of idea.~
@600  = ~I wouldn't think so. Or at least, I'd hope not.~
@601  = ~Don't I have a right to know what kind of companions I'm travelling with?~
@602  = ~I'm just not sure what to think about this. And I'm not sure I want anything to do with it, but I owe you.~
@603  = ~Enough about that though... I've got another question, it's a little more important. When are we next going to eat? I may have to resort to eating the fallen soon, and nobody wants to see that.~
@604  = ~So.~
@605  = ~So?~
@606  = ~Yes?~
@607  = ~What is it?~
@608  = ~I'm not particularly in love with the idea that you've got the blood of a dead god in your veins, or that you might, you know, turn on us at any time.~
@609  = ~But then again, if you stole my comb I might do the same, so I suppose I can live with it for now.~
@610  = ~If I stole your comb, Arath, I doubt the entire Athkatlan Guard could prevent the slaughter.~
@611  = ~I would never steal your comb, Arath. What kind of heinous creature do you think I am?~
@612  = ~I appreciate that, Arath.~
@613  = ~I'm ever so glad you approve.~
@614  = ~What gave you the impression that I care?~
@615  = ~Too true, too true.~
@616  = ~And here I was fairly sure we'd covered that ground?~
@617  = ~I'm just reassuring you I won't poison you or kill you while you sleep, <CHARNAME>. I'm sure a <PRO_MANWOMAN> like yourself can appreciate that.~
@618  = ~Just so we're clear, I'm not comfortable with this. But I'm not going to waste time worrying about it, either.~
@619  = ~I don't expect you to be comfortable with it. I know I'm not.~
@620  = ~Well, thank you for your honesty.~
@621  = ~All I expect you to do is follow my orders. Is that clear?~
@622  = ~I don't care if you're comfortable about it or not.~
@623  = ~You can waste all the time you like, but you're no longer wasting mine.~
@624  = ~That's... good to hear.~
@625  = ~Always! Well, mostly, anyway.~
@626  = ~Well, I don't particularly care if you care that I'm comfortable about it. I do, and really, I'm all that matters to me, so.~
@627  = ~Don't worry, I'm done with this for now.~
@628  = ~Oh gods, I think I'm getting a cramp. Alright. Let's go. Ow.~
@629  = ~How are you feeling?~
@630  = ~Fine? Why do you ask?~
@631  = ~That's so sweet!~
@632  = ~I could kill for some food...~
@633  = ~I'm alright, I suppose.~
@634  = ~Pretty terrible, all things considered.~
@635  = ~That's none of your concern.~
@636  = ~No reason.~
@637  = ~I think I hate you a little bit. Just a bit.~
@638  = ~I'm serious, though.~
@639  = ~Just alright?~
@640  = ~Well, yeah, but...~
@641  = ~Well, it is my concern, since I have to travel with you. So if you don't mind...~
@642  = ~No murderous inclinations? No sudden reversals in temperament? No growing temptation to raze small villages to the ground?~
@643  = ~I'm fine, just a little tired. Really.~
@644  = ~No, no, yes. I think I can feel a dragon form coming on, actually...~
@645  = ~Well I wasn't feeling murderous before you decided to bother me, no.~
@646  = ~Yes, to all of those things. But I'm not about to act on them.~
@647  = ~A little, I have to admit. It's getting more and more difficult to stay in control.~
@648  = ~Well, none of those are unusual for me.~
@649  = ~You will let me know before you go on a murderous rampage, right? You know. Just for old times' sake.~
@650  = ~Very funny.~
@651  = ~Gods, I can't tell if you're joking or not. If there is a dragon form by all means feel free to go right over there where I won't be crushed during your transformation, if not, then you can go right over there just in case.~
@652  = ~Gods, I can't tell if you're joking or not. If you are going to murder me by all means feel free to give me a bit of warning so I can run away, if not, I might run away just in case.~
@653  = ~Well. Uh. Nice that you feel you can be so honest, but that doesn't exactly ease my fears.~
@654  = ~That's... very true. Well. I'll just go stand over there in case you decide to go on a little Bhaal rampage, okay? Call me back when you're done.~
@655  = ~Uh. Not really.~
@656  = ~Just... let me know if there's anything I can do to help. That was all.~
@657  = ~<CHARNAME>, how do you do that thing with your wrist when you cast? I've been trying to figure it out for hours.~
@658  = ~It's easy, you just bend and flick, like this.~
@659  = ~So *that's* what you've been doing! I was starting to wonder...~
@660  = ~If you can't figure it out yourself, it's probably best you don't learn it at all.~
@661  = ~Oh! Like this?~
@662  = ~That makes *much* more sense. Heh.~
@663  = ~... in retrospect, I imagine that would have looked a little suspect.~
@664  = ~Ouch! I'm hurt, <CHARNAME>. Hurt.~
@665  = ~You've really got a flair for magic, you know.~
@666  = ~Thanks. You're not so bad yourself.~
@667  = ~That's sweet, but I really don't.~
@668  = ~What's your angle here, Arath?~
@669  = ~Hardly.~
@670  = ~No, really! You do. Watching you cast is like watching artist at work.~
@671  = ~Angle? No angle, just genuine appreciation! Is that so hard to believe?~
@672  = ~Ah well. It was worth a shot.~
@673  = ~Every time I have to cast something I worry I'll accidentally call lightning down and obliterate us all.~
@674  = ~That... probably doesn't fill you with confidence, does it? Uh. Forget I said anything.~
@675  = ~I have to admire the way you can just blend into the crowd, <CHARNAME>. I've never seen anything quite like it. One minute you're there and I'm talking to you, the next, I'm talking to myself.~
@676  = ~Thank you. It's not that difficult a trick, really.~
@677  = ~I appreciate that, Arath. In my line of work, it's generally when my skills go unnoticed that I'm successful.~
@678  = ~Hah! I doubt that's due to any skill of mine, and rather more your terrible sense of direction.~
@679  = ~It's more that your voice gets very tiresome very quickly.~
@680  = ~I don't know about that. I may as well go walking around with a giant target painted on my back. It might not be difficult for you, but for most of us, it's impressive.~
@681  = ~Huh. I hadn't really thought about it that way before. Well, it's very impressive, and more people should compliment you.~
@682  = ~Hey! My sense of direction is far from terrible. It's... alright, a little bit terrible, but it's not polite to *say* so.~
@683  = ~Anyway. I just wanted to tell you that. We should get going.~
@684  = ~I used to pretend I played the lute when I was little. I always imagined myself as some famous musician, adored for my talent and charm.~
@685  = ~Luckily I do have the charm, but when I actually tried to take up the instrument, it was disastrous. No amount of coaching could help. Every tutor my father hired threw their arms up in disgust.~
@686  = ~I really admire your musical talents. Well, I'm a little jealous, really. It just seems to come so naturally to you.~
@687  = ~Thank you, but nothing ever comes naturally. It took me years of training to get where I am today.~
@688  = ~If I'm really so talented, maybe I should try to teach you?~
@689  = ~Oh, I'm sure you weren't that bad.~
@690  = ~What do you want, Arath?~
@691  = ~You may have had training, but something about the way you play is just... I don't know. Mesmerising. You're better than most.~
@692  = ~Gods, no. I mean no offence, <CHARNAME>, but the days of me wanting to be a minstrel are far behind me. I've also got no wish to revisit memories of tragic, terrible failure on my part.~
@693  = ~But thanks for the offer.~
@694  = ~You really don't want to know. Trust me. If music could make ears bleed, I'm pretty sure my playing would have injured thousands.~
@695  = ~Anyway. I just wanted to tell you that I'd like to hear you play more.~
@696  = ~Come on, we should get going.~
@697  = ~Hey, <CHARNAME>, I just wanted to let you know, you're damn good in battle. I'd hate to be on the other side of the field, let me just say that.~
@698  = ~Thanks, Arath. You're not so bad yourself.~
@699  = ~Practice does make perfect. And I've had a *lot* of practice.~
@700  = ~My skills are nothing to brag about.~
@701  = ~I don't know about that. Every time I have to cast something I worry I'll accidentally call lightning down and obliterate us all.~
@702  = ~That... probably doesn't fill you with confidence, does it?~
@703  = ~This is true. Much more than your average adventurer, I'd wager.~
@704  = ~A man isn't allowed to give a free compliment? What a world it is we live in!~
@705  = ~Anyway, you're quite the sight. In battle, I mean. Well, out of it too, but that's for another conversation. (wink)~
@706  = ~Why, thank you, Arath! It's been at least three hours since you last complimented me.~
@707  = ~I don't know if I have your charm, though.~
@708  = ~How about we make this conversation about that?~
@709  = ~I'm not remotely interested in your flattery, druid.~
@710  = ~Three hours is a long time! I'll have to make sure it doesn't stretch that long next time. (grin)~
@711  = ~That's true. But hey, charm isn't everything! (grin)~
@712  = ~Well, we *could*, but that would take all the fun out of the next conversation!~
@713  = ~Pshh, fine. Be that way.~
@714  = ~So, you're a glorious hero, from what I understand? Savior of the Sword Coast? Striking terror in the hearts of those who oppose you, and adoration into the hearts of the faithful?~
@715  = ~I'm not sure I'd call myself a hero, exactly.~
@716  = ~I'm no hero. Rather the opposite, really.~
@717  = ~Adoration, you say? Obviously I haven't been paying enough attention!~
@718  = ~Hardly. I just do what I need to in order to get the job done.~
@719  = ~We don't have time for meaningless chatter, Arath.~
@720  = ~So, you're a glorious heroine, from what I understand? Savior of the Sword Coast? Striking terror in the hearts of those who oppose you, and adoration into the hearts of the faithful?~
@721  = ~Oh, I don't know. You did save the Sword Coast from ruin, ousted a man who was bound to become a terrible dictator, and resolved several crises along the way.~
@722  = ~Apparently so! I suppose it's not terribly surprising. You did save the Sword Coast from ruin, ousted a man who was bound to become a terrible dictator, and resolved several crises along the way.~
@723  = ~Of course, oh glorious leader.~
@724  = ~Really, I'm surprised there aren't more people falling over themselves to get into your bedroll at night.~
@725  = ~Oh, there are, I'm just very discreet.~
@726  = ~And how do you know there aren't?~
@727  = ~Well, you certainly seem to be.~
@728  = ~I wish I were that lucky.~
@729  = ~Arath! That's entirely inappropriate.~
@730  = ~Oh, I see. Discreet. Well, I'll keep that in mind.~
@731  = ~It's not like I obsessively keep an eye on you while you sleep, or anything.~
@732  = ~I'm kidding. It was a joke. I don't watch you while you sleep. At least, not all the time. (grin)~
@733  = ~Is it that obvious? Huh. And here I thought I was being subtle.~
@734  = ~I can't imagine why not. A good looking guy such as yourself? You shouldn't have any trouble at all!~
@735  = ~I can't imagine why not. A good looking girl such as yourself? You shouldn't have any trouble at all!~
@736  = ~Of course it is. Nothing would be fun if everything were appropriate.~
@737  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you have a moment?~
@738  = ~Of course. What do you need?~
@739  = ~As long as it's a quick moment, sure.~
@740  = ~We really don't, but go ahead.~
@741  = ~Not right now, Arath.~
@742  = ~If you don't mind me saying so, you're a rather attractive <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I'm a rather attractive man. I think you can see where I'm going with this.~
@743  = ~Well that's... direct.~
@744  = ~You are rather attractive, at that. I'll... consider it.~
@745  = ~I'm already three steps ahead of you.~
@746  = ~I'm not interested in anything like you're suggesting.~
@747  = ~I'm not interested in men, Arath.~
@748  = ~Oh come now, <CHARNAME>, a few minutes won't hurt you.~
@749  = ~Subtlety was never my strong point. (grin)~
@750  = ~Good to know. (grin)~
@751  = ~Ah. That's a shame.~
@752  = ~Really? Huh. I was sure you were... but maybe I misjudged you. You are filled with surprises, <CHARNAME>.~
@753  = ~Sorry to have bothered you, then. Forget I said anything.~
@754  = ~I was thinking... maybe we could grab some dinner together. Just the two of us. And some ale, maybe. Might be nice.~
@755  = ~I'd like that.~
@756  = ~Right now? We're a bit busy...~
@757  = ~Sounds awfully prosaic.~
@758  = ~A romantic dinner? Really? That's the best you can come up with?~
@759  = ~On second thought, I'm really not interested.~
@760  = ~Good. Let me know if there's anywhere you'd like to eat. I'm sure we could organize something.~
@761  = ~Not right now. Sometime soon, though. Just let me know if there's anywhere you'd like to eat. I'm sure we could organize something.~
@762  = ~Never underestimate a good romantic dinner, <CHARNAME>. Anyway, the dinner isn't the important part.~
@763  = ~Let me know if there's anywhere you'd like to eat. I'm sure we could organize something.~
@764  = ~Though the venue wouldn't really matter, let's be honest. It's the conversation and what follows that's more interesting. (wink)~
@765  = ~Well, this didn't turn out quite like I'd hoped. I have a nice bottle of wine, though, and the food should be adequate. I had the perfect night planned, but... (sigh)~
@766  = ~Sometimes getting that many rose petals is a little difficult, but I suppose that's a blessing in disguise. I'm not even sure if you like roses.~
@767  = ~I'm sure it will be fine.~
@768  = ~Just for the record? I love roses.~
@769  = ~Even if the food is awful, the company makes up for it.~
@770  = ~We probably could have done a little better.~
@771  = ~This was a mistake.~
@772  = ~I hope so. It will be nice to eat some real food, either way... camp rations can only get a man so far.~
@773  = ~(grin) That's sweet. It will be nice to eat some real food, either way... camp rations can only get a man so far.~
@774  = ~That's alright. It will be nice to eat some real food, either way... camp rations can only get a man so far.~
@775  = ~Hey, a proper dinner will do us both good. It will be nice to eat some real food... camp rations can only get a man so far.~
@776  = ~Most of the places I'd like to take you aren't really open to the public, in the Government District. There was this one restaurant that served the most amazing lobster, smothered in this garlic cream sauce...~
@777  = ~But here we are, so I suppose we should make the most of it. (grin)~
@778  = ~What are you thinking?~
@779  = ~I'm wondering when we're going to get some food. I'm starved.~
@780  = ~Trying to decide what to make of you, to be honest.~
@781  = ~I'm deciding whether I should kiss you a little bit or not.~
@782  = ~Arath... I'm involved with someone else.~
@783  = ~I'm not sure I want to do this.~
@784  = ~I'm trying to figure out what *you're* thinking.~
@785  = ~Me too, to be honest. I feel like I haven't eaten properly in days.~
@786  = ~I am, I hear, an enigma wrapped in a puzzle wrapped in a pretty little bow. I'm nothing complex, <CHARNAME>. Or, well, I am, but I don't have any ulterior motives, if that's what you're worried about.~
@787  = ~Well, I wouldn't be averse to that! But maybe later?~
@788  = ~That doesn't bother me if it doesn't bother you.~
@789  = ~Well... it does bother me. I'm sorry.~
@790  = ~As long as you're sure.~
@791  = ~Well, I can't decide that for you.~
@792  = ~Just that you're looking terribly beautiful tonight.~
@793  = ~Just that you're looking terribly handsome tonight.~
@794  = ~Alright. Well. I'll see you in the morning.~
@795  = ~It's never bothered me before.~
@796  = ~Right. Well.~
@797  = ~I'll see you in the morning, <CHARNAME>.~
@798  = ~There's a lot going on right now. I would never have imagined I'd be involved in something like this two months ago. I suppose around that time you were probably conquering the Sword Coast?~
@799  = ~Somewhere around then, probably, yes. "Bow before me, Sword Coast!" I said, and lo, the Sword Coast did bow.~
@800  = ~If by conquer you mean saved from certain famine and destruction, absolutely.~
@801  = ~Something like that.~
@802  = ~Nobody in their right mind envisions they'll be involved in something like we are.~
@803  = ~Heh. That's good. You make an excellent evil victor, <CHARNAME>. I know I'd get on my knees. (grin)~
@804  = ~Heh. That's good. You make an excellent evil mistress, <CHARNAME>. I'm trembling in my stylish yet affordable boots. (grin)~
@805  = ~Well, there was that, but my way is more fun. (grin)~
@806  = ~And if they do, well, I guess that's how we distinguish the crazy ones from the sane ones. (grin)~
@807  = ~I like you, <CHARNAME>. But I want to make something clear. I'm not interested in anything long-term. In my experience... well, those types of relationships don't tend to work terribly well.~
@808  = ~What I am interested in is you, me, maybe a few ales, a private room, and a distinct lack of clothing. Interested?~
@809  = ~You'll have to try a little harder than that, I'm afraid.~
@810  = ~I think I could manage that.~
@811  = ~Follow me and you'll find out...~
@812  = ~I don't know how much sleep we'll get, but... (grin)~
@813  = ~Arath, I've--I've never done this before.~
@814  = ~I'm interested, but I don't know... this feels wrong.~
@815  = ~There is no way in the nine hells that is happening.~
@816  = ~What I am interested in is you, me, a bottle of wine, some candles, and a private room. Interested?~
@817  = ~I think I could manage that...~
@818  = ~I can be as hard as--heh, no, even I can't say that with a straight face.~
@819  = ~Maybe we can skip the food and get to the interesting part, hmm? (smirk)~
@820  = ~Then you're in for an educational night, I'd say. Don't worry, <CHARNAME>. I know what I'm doing. You're going to enjoy it, I promise.~
@821  = ~Alright.  Just be--careful.~
@822  = ~Then what we we waiting for?~
@823  = ~I don't want to do it this way. I don't know you well enough.~
@824  = ~No. I don't want to do this.~
@825  = ~I'm not interested in some lengthy chase. I want you. Tonight. I'm not sure how much more specific I can get than that.~
@826  = ~Alright. I'm in, as long as you pay for the room. (grin)~
@827  = ~Then what are we waiting for?~
@828  = ~If we're going to do this, it will be on my terms. Not yours.~
@829  = ~I'm not some impressionable young <PRO_GIRLBOY> looking for a quick fix, Arath.~
@830  = ~I don't want to do this.~
@831  = ~(sigh) Well, it was worth a shot. You should get some food. I'll see you in the morning.~
@832  = ~Hey, I'm fine with that. So, handsome, what do you want to do?~
@833  = ~Then why don't we get some food, and see where the night takes us?~
@834  = ~How about we skip the food, then, and get to the fun part?~
@835  = ~Have some food, and go to sleep. I'm exhausted.~
@836  = ~Anything that doesn't involve talking, preferably.~
@837  = ~Hey, I'm fine with that. So, beautiful, what do you want to do?~
@838  = ~Always.~
@839  = ~Ah. Well... fair enough. I suppose I'll have to get to know you a little better, then. (wink)~
@840  = ~That sounds like a plan to me. Lead the way.~
@841  = ~What? But I... but you...~
@842  = ~On your terms. Right.~
@843  = ~I'm sure we can arrange that. Lead the way.~
@844  = ~Let's get some food and head to sleep. We've got a long day ahead of us tomorrow, I'm sure.~
@845  = ~So what do you think of Athkatla so far?~
@846  = ~It's a city, just like any other. There's nothing particularly memorable about it.~
@847  = ~Parts of it are beautiful. Other parts... well, nobody said anything about consistency, I suppose.~
@848  = ~I love it here. There's so much going on, so much intrigue, so many people.~
@849  = ~It's disgusting. The streets are filled with urchins and cutthroats, there's no culture, no class.~
@850  = ~I suppose I don't have much to compare it to. I'll take your word for it.~
@851  = ~Heh. You're right, Athkatla is everything but consistent. Fun, though.~
@852  = ~The amount of people gets tiring after a while, trust me. Why do you think I left and become a druid? (grin)~
@853  = ~Oh, I don't know if I'd say there's *no* class. I mean, I came from here, after all, and I am *all* class. (grin)~
@854  = ~You know, I never really thought Athkatla would be central to anything. It's metropolitan, sure, but nothing ever really happens in Amn.~
@855  = ~Actually, I take that back. A lot happens, but nothing really changes. Then the vampires came along, and, well... you know what's happened since then. And now you're here. It just seems so unlikely.~
@856  = ~You think that's unlikely; imagine what it's like to wake up one day and discover that you're the child of a dead god.~
@857  = ~Life is full of these happy little surprises, I've found.~
@858  = ~Irenicus has changed a lot of things. Trust me when I say that Athkatla is the least of them.~
@859  = ~Well, I'm sorry to have uprooted your delicate little life.~
@860  = ~What's your point, exactly?~
@861  = ~Try as I might, that one eludes me. Maybe if I were the child of the dead god of puppies and kittens. But Bhaal? You certainly got the short end of the stick, my friend.~
@862  = ~Happy little surprises my ass. Life upends you at every turn, and seems determined to make sure you've got no sure direction at any given point in time.~
@863  = ~I suppose you're right. He certainly has a way of reaching out and touching people, doesn't he?~
@864  = ~Hey, I'm not complaining. I'm not sure what I would have done if you hadn't come along, but I'm glad you did.~
@865  = ~Point?~
@866  = ~I don't really have a point. Just talking, I suppose.~
@867  = ~I'm not sure if I've told you, but grew up in the Government District. My father was a lord, we owned a small estate there. I never really liked it much.~
@868  = ~I guess it's not so bad here, really. I mean, apart from the rubbish, and the corruption, and... well, okay, maybe it's not great, but it's home. Or at least, it was.~
@869  = ~What happened? What made you leave?~
@870  = ~Home is where the heart is, so your real home's in your chest, I suppose.~
@871  = ~If your father was a lord, what does that make you?~
@872  = ~Home is where you want it to be.~
@873  = ~Finding out my father was a slaver, for one. There were other reasons too, but that was the main one.~
@874  = ~Heh. I'm not sure how I feel about that. I'd like to think of the grove as home, if I had to choose somewhere. ~
@875  = ~I'm not sure, to be honest. And I'm not really interested in finding out. I turned my back on that part of my life a long time ago.~
@876  = ~That's how I like to think about it. If I had to choose somewhere, it would probably be the grove, but...~
@877  = ~Look, I'm not really one to talk about the past. Maybe another time? I'm sure we've got better things to do. Come on.~
@878  = ~I had the worst dream last night. I don't remember all of it, but I do know it involved cucumber, a harpy and possibly a giant pair of pantaloons.~
@879  = ~That certainly sounds... bizarre, to say the least.~
@880  = ~You lead a very active dream life, I see.~
@881  = ~That doesn't sound terribly bad to me.~
@882  = ~Hey, if that's all you have to deal, lucky you.~
@883  = ~We don't have time for this, Arath.~
@884  = ~Well, it was a lot more frightening in my dream. Out loud it just sounds strange.~
@885  = ~You might be right. Another time, perhaps.~
@886  = ~I don't generally remember my dreams, but I guess it's not everyday you dream about giant killer cucumbers.~
@887  = ~Look, I don't--I didn't really want to say anything, I know it's probably intensely private or personal or whatever, but...~
@888  = ~What kind of dreams do you, uh, deal with? Because some of them sound distinctly... I can't decide whether I should say "scary" or "terrifying." Terrifying seems more apt.~
@889  = ~Since I escaped Irenicus' dungeon, I've been having nightmares. They're not pleasant.~
@890  = ~I'm really sorry about that. I probably keep you all awake at night.~
@891  = ~Terrifying isn't the word I'd use. They're... interesting. They show me things about myself I didn't know.~
@892  = ~I don't want to talk about it.~
@893  = ~Well, it was either that or... (wink)~
@894  = ~No, no--not *all* night! Just... the majority of it. (grin)~
@895  = ~Really? They don't really seem that way when you're asleep. But hey, it's your head. I'll take your word for it.~
@896  = ~That bad, huh? Alright. I'm not going to bug you about it.~
@897  = ~Where do they come from, do you think? I mean, I've never seen anyone with the kind of nightmares you deal with. Even night terrors don't come close.~
@898  = ~I really don't know, but you're right. They're nothing like night terrors.~
@899  = ~I don't know if they really come from anywhere. I have to deal with a lot of awful things.~
@900  = ~Irenicus features in many of them, so I would imagine it has something to do with him.~
@901  = ~They're all to do with the Bhaal essence, so... something related to that, I would guess.~
@902  = ~The sleeping mind has far greater knowledge than the waking mind. They just come from a different part of me.~
@903  = ~Yeah. I don't know either.~
@904  = ~That might be true, but... I don't know.~
@905  = ~That would make sense. He doesn't seem like the most decent person around, and definitely the sort to play with the minds of his opponents.~
@906  = ~I can't say I hadn't thought about that. It would make sense.~
@907  = ~That's a scary thought. Maybe some deep part of my mind is actually a mass-murdering goblin intent on world domination, and only makes itself known as I sleep.~
@908  = ~It definitely doesn't seem normal, that's all. I'm pretty sure most people don't get tortured in their sleep.~
@909  = ~Then again, you've never really been normal, so maybe that's just your body's way of recuperating during the night. (grin)~
@910  = ~A little torture is always a refreshing way to start the day!~
@911  = ~What an awful thought. I really hope not.~
@912  = ~I don't appreciate you making jokes about this, Arath.~
@913  = ~Somehow I doubt that.~
@914  = ~You're a very strange <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>. But somehow, I don't mind.~
@915  = ~You never know!~
@916  = ~That's a shame, isn't it?~
@917  = ~Yeah, me too. But hey, it's funnier than the other options.~
@918  = ~You know, you really do have a rather shapely figure, <CHARNAME>. And trust me when I say, I have some experience in this area.~
@919  = ~You're not so lacking in the attractiveness department yourself, you know.~
@920  = ~I really don't. But it's nice of you to say so.~
@921  = ~A lot of women, hey? How many, exactly?~
@922  = ~Which is your favourite part, exactly?~
@923  = ~I'm not interested in compliments, Arath.~
@924  = ~You're about as subtle as an axe to the head.~
@925  = ~Well, you have seen it more... intimately than most. (wink)~
@926  = ~You know, you really do cut a rather dashing figure, <CHARNAME>. And trust me when I say, I have some experience in this area~
@927  = ~A lot of men, hey? How many, exactly?~
@928  = ~This is true, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again sometime soon. (wink)~
@929  = ~Don't be so harsh on yourself. You're a beautiful woman, <CHARNAME>. Which makes me wonder if you're just angling for more compliments.~
@930  = ~Trust me when I say you don't need to angle.~
@931  = ~Don't be so harsh on yourself. You're an incredibly handsome man, <CHARNAME>. Which makes me wonder if you're just angling for more compliments.~
@932  = ~Less than every one of them and more than none of them. Let's just leave it at that, shall we?~
@933  = ~Hmm... your legs, definitely. There's nothing quite like a good pair of legs, and yours certainly are.~
@934  = ~Hmm... your arms, definitely. There's something about forearms that just does it for me.~
@935  = ~Who needs subtlety when you have hair like this? Let's be honest here, <CHARNAME>. (grin)~
@936  = ~I have seen myself in a mirror every now and then, you know. I'm glad you approve. (grin)~
@937  = ~I'm a little curious. How many people have you been with? Just to compare notes, of course.~
@938  = ~Arath! I can't believe you'd ask me that!~
@939  = ~That's no business of yours.~
@940  = ~More than a few. Less than a lot.~
@941  = ~Apart from you? A few. Not many.~
@942  = ~A few people. Not very many.~
@943  = ~Nobody, apart from you.~
@944  = ~I've never been with anyone.~
@945  = ~Why not? You know I don't care about that sort of thing. I've spent enough time in the land of propriety to learn that at the end of the day, it means absolutely nothing.~
@946  = ~Come to think of it, I seem to remember you saying you were a virgin. Ah, well. And here I was hoping for some exciting stories.~
@947  = ~Maybe I'll just have to tell a few to you, hmm?~
@948  = ~I would really rather you didn't.~
@949  = ~(grin) Sure. I wouldn't mind that.~
@950  = ~I... uh... that is...~
@951  = ~You know, I don't think I've ever met anyone quite like you, <CHARNAME>. And to be honest, I'm not sure if that's an insult or a compliment. Both, maybe.~
@952  = ~Well, I know there's me... but apart from that, I suppose I'll just have to imagine. I'm sure I can manage that.~
@953  = ~Hmm... perhaps we could swap some stories sometime? Share a few of our more interesting conquests?~
@954  = ~Sounds like my idea of a good time.~
@955  = ~I never kiss and tell.~
@956  = ~As long as there's some alcohol involved, I'm game!~
@957  = ~With you? Heh. Not a chance.~
@958  = ~Hmm... perhaps we could swap stories sometime? I could tell you about a few of my experiences, you could share yours...~
@959  = ~You know, I don't think I've been someone's first before. Not that I know of, anyway.~
@960  = ~I can't say the idea is... unpleasant.~
@961  = ~Then you're one of the virtuous few, my friend. I'm not sure how you do it, myself, but I suppose there's a certain... honor in it.~
@962  = ~Then you're one of the virtuous few, my dear <CHARNAME>. I'm not sure how you do it, myself, but I suppose there's a certain... honor in it.~
@963  = ~I'm not going to lie and say I'm some blushing maiden, because I'm not. I'm sure you've realized that by now. I've never seen much point to virtue, myself, or fidelity, really, for that matter.~
@964  = ~Sex is sex. It's a physical thing, not an emotional thing, and I've never felt the need to complicate it.~
@965  = ~In any case, any more of this and I know my breeches are going to require a little adjustment, so let's head off. I'm sure there are plenty of other things we can talk about.~
@966  = ~The weather, maybe. (wink)~
@967  = ~Prude. (grin)~
@968  = ~I'll have to do some thinking, then, and wrack my brains for some of the more interesting ones. (wink)~
@969  = ~You're terribly cute when you're tongue-tied. I just thought you should know.~
@970  = ~Ahh, so you're one of *those*. I should have known. There's no fun in it if you can't recount the tale later, <CHARNAME>!~
@971  = ~Ah, well. At least I can share some of mine.~
@972  = ~Heh! I'll have to make sure we have something on hand, and wrack my brains for some of the more interesting liasons I've had. (wink)~
@973  = ~I'm hurt. Really, <CHARNAME>, that's totally unnecessary. Ouch.~
@974  = ~I'll be over here, crying my eyes out into my sleeve. No, don't feel the need to come and comfort me. I'd rather bear my suffering alone.~
@975  = ~I wish we had a hot-tub. Something like Aran Linvail has, except... somehow magically portable. That would be amazing.~
@976  = ~I wish we had a hot-tub. A big, comfortable, soothing hot-tub... that was somehow magically portable. That would be amazing.~
@977  = ~I feel like it's been months since I've had a proper soak. And gods, I need it. I'm dirty in places I didn't even know existed. And I don't mean that in a sexy way.~
@978  = ~We'll see what we can do at the next inn we stop by, maybe.~
@979  = ~Ohh, yes... with some kind of magical bubble dispenser. Oh! And a fluffy towel dispenser!~
@980  = ~Ahh, but this is the charm of life on the road! Makes you appreciate everything more.~
@981  = ~You are so incredibly shallow, sometimes. Do you have any depth to you whatsoever?~
@982  = ~Aren't you supposed to be against things like that? You are a druid, after all.~
@983  = ~Deal with it. Wash on your own time.~
@984  = ~It won't be the same. This is one of the things I miss about not living like a noble anymore... ahh, hot water on demand. So many good memories.~
@985  = ~Mmm, that sounds perfect. I knew you and I had some excellent things in common.~
@986  = ~I don't usually have a dagger in my gut, but that doesn't make me appreciate it more.~
@987  = ~Uh. That made a lot more sense in my head.~
@988  = ~Pshh, I have plenty of depth. I just usually drain it off. (grin)~
@989  = ~Hey, just because I'm a proponent of protecting and serving nature doesn't mean I can't enjoy a good bath.~
@990  = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. (grimace)~
@991  = ~It's not just the dirt, though. I don't know. Sometimes I think there really are parts of me, inside, that will never be the same. That I'll never be able to wash clean.~
@992  = ~I never thought I'd kill people. It just never really crossed my mind as something I'd ever have to do. And then I did.~
@993  = ~I'm not saying I shouldn't have, but... do you have any idea what I mean? Heh. It must sound kind of ridiculous.~
@994  = ~It doesn't sound ridiculous at all. I felt exactly the same way, up until an assassin tried to kill me back in Candlekeep.~
@995  = ~We do what we must in order to survive. Sometimes that involves things we don't expect.~
@996  = ~Death is a natural part of life. Sometimes you just have to accept that.~
@997  = ~Get over it. It's kill or be killed, and somehow I doubt you'd want the latter.~
@998  = ~An assassin? Wow... well, that's a compliment, in a way. Somebody thought you were dangerous or important enough to kill. Way to show me up there, <CHARNAME>.~
@999  = ~I'm glad it's not just me, though. Not that I had assassins sent after me, but... you know what I mean.~
@1000 = ~And sometimes that involves a little mayhem and bloodshed. Nothing I haven't heard or thought before, trust me.~
@1001 = ~I know that better than most. I know how it works... us supposedly more 'intelligent' creatures tend to mess up the normal cycle of things, though.~
@1002 = ~Nothing I haven't thought before. I know how it works. Didn't make it any less unexpected at the time.~
@1003 = ~I don't usually talk like this. Something about you just makes me open my mouth and spew out whatever's on my mind.~
@1004 = ~Enough of that, though. I think I've done quite enough soul searching for today.~
@1005 = ~Ugh... okay, maybe aloe... or a mint compress... no, that won't work, I need something a little more astringent...~
@1006 = ~What are you up to there?~
@1007 = ~What kind of terrible concoction are you creating today?~
@1008 = ~Anything I can help with?~
@1009 = ~Sounds like fun.~
@1010 = ~(ignore him)~
@1011 = ~I'm not really sure yet.~
@1012 = ~You have no idea.~
@1013 = ~What on Faerun could have given me a rash like that? Ugh... alright... keep thinking...~
@1014 = ~I, uh. This is a little embarassing. I'm trying to find the best way to counteract a rash. The problem is, I'm just not sure how I contracted it.~
@1015 = ~What kind of rash, exactly?~
@1016 = ~Oh, god. Should I be worried?~
@1017 = ~Isn't that fairly elementary?~
@1018 = ~Have fun with that.~
@1019 = ~Looks like a poison ivy rash to me.~
@1020 = ~It's nothing serious, just annoying and itchy. Very annoying and itchy.~
@1021 = ~No, no, it's nothing like that. At least, I don't think so.~
@1022 = ~I'm--I'm fine, just a little itchy and confused. I'm not quite sure how...~
@1023 = ~Rashes can be contracted from all sorts of things. I'm not quite sure how...~
@1024 = ~Ugh. Thanks.~
@1025 = ~I was trying to find a certain plant, and I must have brushed past something I shouldn't have. Could be an allergy, maybe, but I thought by now I'd have come into contact with most things...~
@1026 = ~Oh. Oh, no. Great. You're going to laugh at me.~
@1027 = ~I really won't. Don't worry.~
@1028 = ~I'll be honest: I probably will.~
@1029 = ~When am I not laughing at you?~
@1030 = ~I'm relatively sure this is a poison ivy rash. Ugh. I can't believe I didn't think of that earlier. And I'm supposed to be a druid...~
@1031 = ~I... I think I need some time alone. Gods, this is embarassing. I'll talk to you later.~
@1032 = ~You grew up in Candlekeep, right? I've heard you mention it before. You were fostered with Imoen -- the girl we're saving?~
@1033 = ~Yeah. That's right.~
@1034 = ~Do we have to talk about Imoen?~
@1035 = ~I grew up in Candlekeep, and Imoen and I were raised by a mage by the name of Gorion.~
@1036 = ~I'd rather leave the past where it is, if that's alright.~
@1037 = ~I'm a little jealous of you, if I'm totally honest.~
@1038 = ~Not really, but... well. I'd like to get to know a little about her at some point, considering everything.~
@1039 = ~Sure. No problem.~
@1040 = ~I know what you mean. No problem.~
@1041 = ~I always wanted a sibling as a kid. I was an only child, obviously. My father was always fairly busy, and my mother died when I was fairly young, so I was mainly raised by the myself.~
@1042 = ~And the maids, of course. But I always wanted a sibling. Though really, in retrospect, I think I liked the idea of having a sibling more than I would have liked the reality of it.~
@1043 = ~Trust me when I say, you are completely correct in that assumption.~
@1044 = ~Siblings can be a pain, but... at the end of the day, it's worth it to have someone at your back.~
@1045 = ~I wouldn't trade Imoen for the world.~
@1046 = ~Trust me, if I had the choice, I'd have been an only child as well.~
@1047 = ~Are you and your foster sister very close?~
@1048 = ~Very. We're usually inseparable.~
@1049 = ~I love her because she's my sister, but we're not really close.~
@1050 = ~Not really, no. I put up with her because it's what Gorion would want.~
@1051 = ~She's an annoying brat. I'm glad Irenicus took her, because it means I don't have to deal with her.~
@1052 = ~Huh. Fair enough. I take it you and your sister aren't very close?~
@1053 = ~I love her because she's my sister, but we're not really close, no.~
@1054 = ~I'm looking forward to meeting her. She certainly sounds like she'll be... interesting, to say the least.~
@1055 = ~See, I can't understand that. I suppose I probably never will.~
@1056 = ~That I can understand. Well, I'm glad I didn't have siblings, then. They sound painful.~
@1057 = ~I'm looking forward to meeting her, though. She certainly sounds like she'll be... interesting, to say the least.~
@1058 = ~<CHARNAME>, you look terrible. You should really try to get more sleep. Those bags under your eyes won't go away by themselves, you know.~
@1059 = ~I'm fine. Really, Arath, there's no need to worry about me.~
@1060 = ~I know. I'm not sure what I can do about it, though. I just can't sleep.~
@1061 = ~Right. Thanks. Because that's exactly what I needed to hear right now.~
@1062 = ~Trust me, Arath, looking good is the last thing on my agenda right now.~
@1063 = ~Let's not do this right now.~
@1064 = ~You need to rest. There's no chance we could take a few days and recuperate? I don't think you're the only one who needs a break, though you're definitely the one who needs it most.~
@1065 = ~We can't afford to lose time. There's so much we have to do, and we're working against a running clock.~
@1066 = ~You don't think we'd be doing that if we could?~
@1067 = ~No. There is absolutely no chance, so don't even consider it.~
@1068 = ~You just want some time off for yourself. It's nothing to do with me.~
@1069 = ~Don't tempt me. There's nothing I'd like to do more. But... we can't. You know that.~
@1070 = ~Thanks. You're just a little ray of sunshine. Just leave me alone, Arath.~
@1071 = ~That's me, adding a little brightness to each and every day!~
@1072 = ~(sigh) Alright. But... you really should try to get some sleep sometime.~
@1073 = ~I don't think I've ever gone this long without a few days break. I'm not great, but... you've been doing this a lot longer than I have. I don't know how you're even holding together.~
@1074 = ~Because I have to. If you were in my position, you would, too.~
@1075 = ~I'm not, really. I've just become very good at pretending I am.~
@1076 = ~When this is all over, I'll be in pieces somewhere, don't you worry.~
@1077 = ~I've never had a problem holding together. It's falling apart I can't do.~
@1078 = ~Nothing really gets to me. This is what I'm good at.~
@1079 = ~I don't know about that. You're a very strong <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>. Stronger than most, I'd wager.~
@1080 = ~ You're a very strong <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>. Stronger than most, I'd wager.~
@1081 = ~It's one of the things that attracts me to you, actually.~
@1082 = ~Nice weather, hey?~
@1083 = ~It's... not bad, I guess.~
@1084 = ~Pretty nice, yeah.~
@1085 = ~You want to talk about the weather? Really?~
@1086 = ~What do you want?~
@1087 = ~What's wrong with the weather? The weather is a perfectly acceptable topic for conversation! If I were the weather, I'd be offended. Just so you know.~
@1088 = ~Uh, nothing? I just wanted to have a talk. Is that so wrong?~
@1089 = ~Yeahhh. And, uh... it's not raining, so that's good. Not that I mind rain, just when we're adventuring, you know... it gets... annoying.~
@1090 = ~I'm, ah. Not very good at this. The whole small-talk thing. I was trained to do it when I was a child, but now it just seems so pointless.~
@1091 = ~You don't need to make small talk with me, Arath. (grin)~
@1092 = ~You might not be good at it, but you're terribly cute when you try.~
@1093 = ~You were trained to do it? Why?~
@1094 = ~It *is* pointless.~
@1095 = ~I know. I'm just trying to find a way to say what I actually want to say, but I'm not sure how to say it, so... yeah. Heh.~
@1096 = ~Heh. Thanks. I'm just trying to find a way to say what I actually want to say, but I'm not sure how to say it, so... yeah.~
@1097 = ~Uh. I was raised as a noble, <CHARNAME>. Of course I learnt societal niceties.~
@1098 = ~Really, I'm just trying to find a way to say what I actually want to say, but I'm not sure how to say it, so... yeah. Heh.~
@1099 = ~I like you quite a bit, <CHARNAME>. And to be honest, I'm not really sure how to deal with that. I enjoy talking to you, spending time with you... having sex with you. (grin)~
@1100 = ~Anyway. I just... thought you should know.~
@1101 = ~I like you too, Arath. In case you hadn't realized.~
@1102 = ~Oh. I didn't realise. Because the sex was definitely not a giveaway.~
@1103 = ~Well, thanks. I appreciate that. (grin)~
@1104 = ~I'm not exactly sure what you mean.~
@1105 = ~I'm not interested in anything beyond what we have, Arath.~
@1106 = ~Well, I had some idea. (wink)~
@1107 = ~Hey, I've slept with people I didn't like before! It was pretty good most of the time, actually. Fiery, heh.~
@1108 = ~Any time!~
@1109 = ~I'm not sure I am either, but I thought you should know.~
@1110 = ~Neither am I, really, but... I wanted to let you know anyway.~
@1111 = ~I'm going to pretend that I've got something to be busy with now, because I'm not really sure what else to say, so. Uh. Yeah.~
@1112 = ~You look like you haven't slept in weeks. I know you actually haven't slept in weeks, but you're starting to *look* it.~
@1113 = ~I know. (sigh)~
@1114 = ~If you have any suggestions, I'm all ears.~
@1115 = ~Thanks, Arath. Because that's exactly what I needed to hear right now.~
@1116 = ~Go fly a kite, Arath.~
@1117 = ~That... sounded a lot better in my head. I didn't mean to--~
@1118 = ~I wish I did. Look, that sounded a lot better in my head, I didn't mean to--~
@1119 = ~If it's any consolation, it sounded a lot better in my head. I didn't mean to--~
@1120 = ~No, wait, I didn't mean to--~
@1121 = ~I'm just concerned. Are you alright? Do you need some water, or something? Is there anything I can do?~
@1122 = ~You could give me a hug, for starters. After that... I don't know. I really don't.~
@1123 = ~Got a spare soul lying around? Because that'd sure be useless right about now.~
@1124 = ~There's nothing anyone can do.~
@1125 = ~You can stop treating me like an invalid.~
@1126 = ~I just feel useless. I'm not... used to feeling useless. I want to *do* something, and it just, I just want to--to make it better, and it's just so frustrating that I can't *do* anything!~
@1127 = ~You don't have to convince me. I know exactly what you mean.~
@1128 = ~Calm down. You're not helping anyone by shouting.~
@1129 = ~This isn't about me, it's about you, and I'm not interested in hearing it.~
@1130 = ~I've got enough to deal with without you getting angry!~
@1131 = ~... okay. Wow, I didn't--I didn't mean to shout at you.~
@1132 = ~... okay. You're right. I didn't--I didn't mean to shout at you. I know it's not your fault.~
@1133 = ~It just gets to me that we have to go around as though nothing's wrong, pretending that you're fine, when you barely sleep and you look half-dead.~
@1134 = ~Okay, this... really isn't going well. Let's just get going, before I say something else offensive.~
@1135 = ~How does it feel?~
@1136 = ~How does what feel?~
@1137 = ~Soft, porous, a little bit elastic...~
@1138 = ~Not having a soul, you mean?~
@1139 = ~We don't have time for nonsense questions, Arath.~
@1140 = ~... what are you talking about?~
@1141 = ~Yeah. Does it... hurt? Can you feel that it isn't there?~
@1142 = ~It's hard to explain. It's like there's just this... blank space. I can feel it's missing, but it doesn't hurt.~
@1143 = ~How do you think you'd feel if your soul had been ripped from your body?~
@1144 = ~In all honesty, I'm not sure what the difference is. I don't feel any different.~
@1145 = ~I don't remember what having a soul feels like in the first place. I've nothing to compare it against.~
@1146 = ~Don't you think asking that's a little bit insensitive?~
@1147 = ~It's not a nonsense question. Really.~
@1148 = ~How does it feel, not having a soul? Does it... hurt? Can you feel that it isn't there?~
@1149 = ~Not having a soul, I mean. Does it... hurt? Can you feel that it isn't there?~
@1150 = ~I don't know. That's why I'm asking. It's not like they give classes on this sort of thing.~
@1151 = ~Uh. Is it? I was just curious. I mean, it's not like they give classes on this sort of thing.~
@1152 = ~Oh. Alright. Well, I'm here if you change your mind.~
@1153 = ~What do you think will happen if it never... you know, comes back?~
@1154 = ~I don't know. I really don't.~
@1155 = ~I'm not sure, but I don't know how long you can survive without a soul.~
@1156 = ~I'll probably become a childkiller, or something equally heinous.~
@1157 = ~Not something I want to talk about right now.~
@1158 = ~I've never really know anyone without a soul before, but if I knew, I'd tell you.~
@1159 = ~Heh. "Need to murder all those kids to get to the golden key? No problem!" "Need to topple the best leader this city has had in a hundred years for money? Consider it done!"~
@1160 = ~That's in really bad taste, Arath.~
@1161 = ~While I admit that is funny, now's really not the time.~
@1162 = ~"Need me to drown those puppies in order to find out how long they survive? Absolutely!"~
@1163 = ~Shut your mouth. That's *me* you're talking about!~
@1164 = ~Sure. Let's get going, then.~
@1165 = ~Losing your conscience would probably make some things a lot easier, though. "Need to murder all those kids to get to the golden key? No problem!" "Need to topple the best leader this city has had in a hundred years for money? Already did it!"~
@1166 = ~Yeah. Yeah, it is. Heh.~
@1167 = ~Uh. Sorry.~
@1168 = ~Heh. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. Puppies are adorable!~
@1169 = ~Here. Drink this.~
@1170 = ~Uh. What is it, first?~
@1171 = ~Why should I?~
@1172 = ~Not a chance.~
@1173 = ~It's a drought intended to make you feel a little better. You're not eating right, you're not drinking enough water, you're...~
@1174 = ~It's a drought intended to make you feel a little better. You're not eating right, you're not drinking enough water, you're... just drink it, okay?~
@1175 = ~Fine, fine! Sheesh. No need to get so touchy.~
@1176 = ~Alright. For you.~
@1177 = ~If it'll make you stop whining, sure.~
@1178 = ~I'm not drinking anything, and that's final.~
@1179 = ~Good. It'll at least help get some nutrients into you, if nothing else.~
@1180 = ~I'm not whining! I'm just--~
@1181 = ~(sigh) Fine. I'm just...~
@1182 = ~I'm just worried about you.~
@1183 = ~You? Worried about *me*? Gods, who are you and what have you done with Arath?~
@1184 = ~You've got nothing to worry about. I'll be fine.~
@1185 = ~So what, you're going to mother me?~
@1186 = ~Yeah. Me too.~
@1187 = ~Well, I'm glad you think so, because I'm not so sure.~
@1188 = ~If I have to.~
@1189 = ~Gods, I need something to drink.~
@1190 = ~Don't be silly. I do that enough for both of us.~
@1191 = ~Will you stop it?! Just stop it, stop looking at me like that, stop--stop looking so sick! I'm so bloody tired of having to look after you!~
@1192 = ~Where's this come from?!~
@1193 = ~Arath, what's going on?~
@1194 = ~What are you talking about? You don't have to look after me at all!~
@1195 = ~And I'm so bloody tired of hearing you go on and on!~
@1196 = ~I can't do this anymore. I just... I can't. I can't look at you every day, feeling the way I do about you, and watch you...~
@1197 = ~It's over, <CHARNAME>. I'll stick around and help you, but... I can't do it anymore.~
@1198 = ~So that's it? The going gets tough, so you get going?~
@1199 = ~Wow. Um. I don't... I don't really know what to say.~
@1200 = ~Arath, please. We can work this out.~
@1201 = ~I was sick and tired of hearing your voice all the time anyway.~
@1202 = ~I didn't want this! I didn't want some kind of messed up relationship, it was just meant to be--~
@1203 = ~Forget it.~
@1204 = ~I think it's best if we just... pretend this never happened.~
@1205 = ~Don't just... stop looking at me like that! I said it and I meant it. We're done.~
@1206 = ~<CHARNAME>?~
@1207 = ~I'm.. going to kiss you, now.~
@1208 = ~(kiss him)~
@1209 = ~Arath... are you drunk?~
@1210 = ~What do you think you're doing?!~
@1211 = ~Go away, Arath. I'm not interested.~
@1212 = ~Stay with me. Just for tonight. We don't have to do anything.~
@1213 = ~Please.~
@1214 = ~Of course.~
@1215 = ~Are you sure this is what you want?~
@1216 = ~I'm not going to take advantage of you.~
@1217 = ~You said we were through, Arath.~
@1218 = ~I can't do this again. I'm sorry.~
@1219 = ~Get lost, Arath.~
@1220 = ~I'm sorry for what I said. I miss you.~
@1221 = ~I miss you too.~
@1222 = ~Let's not talk, okay? We can talk tomorrow.~
@1223 = ~This is just for tonight, okay? Nothing more than that.~
@1224 = ~Are you really sorry?~
@1225 = ~Yes. I'm sure. Please, I just want... I want to have you next to me.~
@1226 = ~You don't need to convince me.~
@1227 = ~Alright. But just for tonight.~
@1228 = ~I can't. I'm sorry.~
@1229 = ~Well, too bad. You made your decision.~
@1230 = ~You won't be. Please, I just want... I want to have you next to me.~
@1231 = ~Forget what I said, okay? Please, I just want... I want to have you next to me.~
@1232 = ~Oh.~
@1233 = ~I just thought...~
@1234 = ~Okay. Goodnight, <CHARNAME>. I'm... I'm sorry for what I said, the other day. I miss you.~
@1235 = ~(yawn) I'm pretty tired. I drank a bit too much, I think... woah, okay, um, I'm just gonna lie here. Here is good.~
@1236 = ~Goodnight, <CHARNAME>. I really am sorry for what I said.~
@1237 = ~Yeah. I miss you.~
@1238 = ~Okay. Goodnight, <CHARNAME>. I'm... I really am sorry for what I said, the other day.~
@1239 = ~I'm not... I don't know if I want a forever after. But I want you. I'm not sure I want to *be* with you, though. It's... complicated.~
@1240 = ~Well, try to explain.~
@1241 = ~You're either with me or you're not, Arath. There is no in-between.~
@1242 = ~Well, I do want a forever after. And if you're not able to be that guy...~
@1243 = ~If it helps, I know I *don't*. So that simplifies things for you enormously.~
@1244 = ~I... I could be. I don't know.~
@1245 = ~I'm... I. That does... simplify things. Okay. Fine. I guess that's it then.~
@1246 = ~I've never done this before. A relationship, I mean. I don't know how it works. And that just... I don't like not knowing. I've... I'ver never let it get this far before.~
@1247 = ~I don't know why. Well, I do, but it's... I don't know, it probably sounds ridiculous.~
@1248 = ~Somehow, I doubt that.~
@1249 = ~Don't worry, if it is, I'll let you know.~
@1250 = ~Do I look like I'm going to laugh at you?~
@1251 = ~(stay silent)~
@1252 = ~Right.~
@1253 = ~I guess not.~
@1254 = ~Not many people... I've never--people leave me. I let someone in and they leave me. And I was... I was scared you would, too. Maybe not right away, but... one way or another.~
@1255 = ~You're an idiot. I love you, Arath. I have for quite a while, and I'm not going to leave you.~
@1256 = ~I'm not going to leave you anytime soon, Arath. I like you far too much to do that to you.~
@1257 = ~Is that what this is all about? You're worried I'm going to abandon you, so you abandon me first?~
@1258 = ~I thought you wanted something that wasn't serious?~
@1259 = ~Right. So is that any excuse to treat me like you did?~
@1260 = ~Oh, Arath. Come here. (hug him)~
@1261 = ~Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith.~
@1262 = ~That is the most pathetic excuse I have quite literally ever heard.~
@1263 = ~Oh. That's a... love is a big word, <CHARNAME>. I don't know if I'm exactly comfortable with that... but...~
@1264 = ~I... I do want to be with you. But I really have no idea what I'm doing, I don't know how it works.~
@1265 = ~Then let me teach you.~
@1266 = ~Well, it starts with you kissing me. Then we'll see where it goes from there.~
@1267 = ~You're not alone there. I've never done this either, but I want to try.~
@1268 = ~I don't think I could do this, Arath. I'm sorry.~
@1269 = ~After treating me like you did, you think you can act cute and I'll just forgive you?~
@1270 = ~(mutters) I told you it was ridiculous.~
@1271 = ~I did. Initially. Or, I thought I did. But now...~
@1272 = ~I am sorry for what I did. I said that last night, and I meant it. I want to try to make this work.~
@1273 = ~I think I might be able to do that.~
@1274 = ~That... that sounds good to me, <CHARNAME>. I'd like to try.~
@1275 = ~... oh. I'm...~
@1276 = ~Okay. I guess that's that, then. I... I wish we could have. Worked out, I mean. I'm sorry.~
@1277 = ~I...~
@1278 = ~I'm not trying to act cute. I hoped that maybe... but I was wrong, obviously. I'm sorry.~
@1279 = ~You're not wrong. I just wish you weren't such an ass sometimes.~
@1280 = ~You really hurt me, Arath.~
@1281 = ~It was never going to work.~
@1282 = ~You were. Definitely.~
@1283 = ~(grin) Well, don't hold your breath, but... I'll try.~
@1284 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. I do like you a lot, and... I really do want to make this work.~
@1285 = ~Come on, let's get moving. We're starting to get odd looks.~
@1286 = ~I know. And I'm sorry about that. I really am. But... I'd like to try to make this work. If... if you want. I mean.~
@1287 = ~I'm not going to pretend that everything is okay, but... I do want that. I want this relationship. But you need to try, not just me.~
@1288 = ~Apology accepted. I just wanted to see how far I could jerk your chain. Of course I want to be with you. (grin)~
@1289 = ~I can't. I'm sorry, Arath.~
@1290 = ~I don't. Not after being rejected like that.~
@1291 = ~Maybe, but...~
@1292 = ~I'm sorry.~
@1293 = ~I will. I promise.~
@1294 = ~I can't believe you'd do that! That's so...~
@1295 = ~You're evil, <CHARNAME>. Pure, unadulterated evil. And I like it. (grin)~
@1296 = ~Me too.~
@1297 = ~I... that's fair enough.~
@1298 = ~I guess that's that, then. (sigh)~
@1299 = ~Did I ever tell you how I became a druid?~
@1300 = ~I don't think you have, no.~
@1301 = ~No, but I'd like to find out.~
@1302 = ~I just figured you tripped over one day, blacked out, and woke up with druidic powers.~
@1303 = ~Is it important?~
@1304 = ~Sort of. I guess it is. To me, anyway. I want you to understand me a bit better.~
@1305 = ~Heh, that's good. I'll have to remember that one.~
@1306 = ~When I was little, I didn't get to... I didn't know very many people. Or, I knew a lot of people, but didn't really get to know anybody *well*. My father took care of that.~
@1307 = ~After my mother died, I didn't really... I didn't have anyone, apart from the nurses who looked after me, and gods know they didn't care. But... we had a gardener, who tended the grounds around our estate.~
@1308 = ~He sort of took me under his wing. Showed me how to look after some of the plants, taught me about them. I had an excellent memory, and... I don't know. A lot of what he taught me stuck.~
@1309 = ~After a while, he went away, but father didn't hire another groundskeeper. I did what I could. And I found myself--whenever I was frustrated or angry or sad or whatever, I would go into the garden and think, and... it made me feel better.~
@1310 = ~Sounds a bit odd out loud, heh. Is this, uh, making any sense whatsoever? If it's not, just tell me.~
@1311 = ~It's not that odd. I know exactly what you mean.~
@1312 = ~Well, not much, but it's nice to listen to anyway. (grin)~
@1313 = ~No, you're fine.~
@1314 = ~It's making sense, I don't know if it's providing much insight so far.~
@1315 = ~Heh. Well at least I'm providing some entertainment!~
@1316 = ~I'm getting there, don't worry.~
@1317 = ~When I found out about... you know, my father being a slaver and all, I couldn't stay at the manse any longer. I needed to get out, to... I don't know, really. But I needed to go.~
@1318 = ~I went to the one place I knew he'd never find me. I'd never been to the slums before, and they... well, it shocked me a bit. I didn't realise. I was only there for a few weeks, but I quickly learnt how to survive.~
@1319 = ~A herbalist took me in, mainly because I was able to find things she needed. I had a knack for spotting obscure plants, and in exchange she taught me a little of what she knew. She was the one who recommended me to the druids.~
@1320 = ~Not knowing what else to do, I went. And... well, that's the story, I guess. I'm not sure I've ever actually told anyone the whole thing before.~
@1321 = ~I know I don't talk much about my past. I thought maybe if I did you'd understand me a bit better. Bit pathetic when I think about it, heh~
@1322 = ~(hug him)~
@1323 = ~It's not pathetic at all. Thanks for sharing it with me.~
@1324 = ~Not your average route to becoming a druid, I'd imagine.~
@1325 = ~A bit, but I'm not going to hold it against you. (grin)~
@1326 = ~That was... unexpected. But nice. Thanks. (grin)~
@1327 = ~Alright, enough of me talking at you. We've got work to do.~
@1328 = ~Definitely not. Most people are raised in that lifestyle, or follow some inner calling. For me, it was just... it just fit, somehow.~
@1329 = ~Good. (grin)~
@1330 = ~Hey, uh. I made you this.~
@1331 = ~That's so sweet! What is it, exactly?~
@1332 = ~What on Faerun is that?~
@1333 = ~That's... lovely. Thank you.~
@1334 = ~You are a romantic failure.~
@1335 = ~It's a woven grass bracelet. Or... it was, anyway. I think I must have broken it in my pocket. Ugh.~
@1336 = ~What I *wanted* to give you was a carved statue of a lion, but that proved problematic, because I couldn't find the right material to carve it with, or the right tools.~
@1337 = ~Well, that and I don't really know how to carve. But I had hoped to pick it up as I go.~
@1338 = ~Anyway. I'm... I wanted to tell you that I'm a lucky man, to have such a handsome guy as yourself as his... his partner. Lover. I'm not really sure what to call you, heh.~
@1339 = ~Either is fine. You're awfully cute, yourself, you know.~
@1340 = ~I'm the lucky one, Arath, not you.~
@1341 = ~I don't care what you call me, as long as I can call you mine.~
@1342 = ~What I *wanted* to give you was a carved statue of a lioness, but that proved problematic, because I couldn't find the right material to carve it with, or the right tools.~
@1343 = ~Anyway. I'm... I wanted to tell you that I'm a lucky man, to have such a beautiful woman as yourself as his... his partner. Lover. I'm not really sure what to call you, heh.~
@1344 = ~Mmm... you know, I've kissed a lot of people, <CHARNAME>. But I don't think I've ever meant it as much as when I kiss you.~
@1345 = ~I know. (grin)~
@1346 = ~Hardly. I'm the emotional cripple here, not you. Unable to deal with his own emotions, a wreck at the slightest provocation.~
@1347 = ~Alright, well, not really, but it sounds pretty deep and dramatic. (grin)~
@1348 = ~Awww. That's so sweet. Do any more of that and I think I might vomit rainbows, <CHARNAME>, so be careful.~
@1349 = ~Whatever this is we have... I like it. It's scary, and new, and... sometimes a bit disturbing to think about, but... I want it. And I want you. Desperately.~
@1350 = ~In fact, if there weren't people around, I'd probably tear off your clothes right now. I'm just saying.~
@1351 = ~I wouldn't mind that, as long as I could tear off yours first!~
@1352 = ~Well, we can always go somewhere a little more... private.~
@1353 = ~Slow down there, cowboy. Let's save that for later.~
@1354 = ~You're a real romantic at heart, aren't you?~
@1355 = ~I'm sure we could arrange something like that. Maybe not right now, though.~
@1356 = ~Heh, as much as I'd like that, I think we have more pressing matters to attend to. And there's always after everyone else has gone to sleep. (wink)~
@1357 = ~I wasn't suggesting right now! There's always after everyone else has gone to sleep. (wink)~
@1358 = ~Of course! A romantic to the end, I swear.~
@1359 = ~I don't know where this will go, but I want to be with you. So... yeah. I hope you do, too.~
@1360 = ~If I didn't want to be with you, I wouldn't be here right now.~
@1361 = ~I love you. I'm not about to go anywhere.~
@1362 = ~I don't know where this will go, either, but I like what we have.~
@1363 = ~You're... very sweet, Arath. But I don't think I do want this.~
@1364 = ~I guess you have a point. I hope you don't mind if I stick around a little while longer, then... my gorgeous <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@1365 = ~I know. I hope you don't mind if I stick around a little while longer, then... my gorgeous <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@1366 = ~Good. I hope you don't mind if I stick around a little while longer, then... my gorgeous <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@1367 = ~But... I made you a bracelet. And...~
@1368 = ~I can't believe you. Fine, then, if that's what you want. I... wish you felt differently.~
@1369 = ~Something about sleeping amidst nature is incredibly intoxicating. The smell of the trees, the grass beneath your feet...~
@1370 = ~Primal, I guess is the word. It feels primal. Like all that matters is hunting, and killing, and eating, and sex.~
@1371 = ~I want you, <CHARNAME>. I want to have you, here, underneath the stars, our bodies' frenzied movement all that stirs the forest around us as nature looks on.~
@1372 = ~I want to feel your taut muscles on mine, your arms around me as we climax. I want your kiss-swollen lips on mine as we lie, panting, on the earth that bore us.~
@1373 = ~I want to feel your body writhing under mine, your nails on my back as you climax, and again. I want your kiss-swollen lips on mine as I thrust into you, groaning, on the earth that bore us.~
@1374 = ~Sound good to you, <CHARNAME>? Up for a frolic in the woods? (wink)~
@1375 = ~A frolic in the woods, hmm? As long as that's not all we'll be doing, I'm in.~
@1376 = ~I'm not interested in having sex with you, Arath. I thought I'd made that clear.~
@1377 = ~Oh gods, Arath, you read a lot of really bad romance novels as a child, didn't you?~
@1378 = ~I don't know...~
@1379 = ~Not a chance, my friend. But it was worth a shot. (grin)~
@1380 = ~Absolutely not! What kind of <PRO_MANWOMAN> do you think I am?!~
@1381 = ~Get lost.~
@1382 = ~I thought maybe we could see if there's a stream around, maybe have a quick dip... find a nice clearing... what do you think?~
@1383 = ~Sounds like my kind of night!~
@1384 = ~Have sex... in a clearing? Outside? Are you insane?~
@1385 = ~I don't think so. Another time, maybe.~
@1386 = ~I'm not interested in you like that, Arath.~
@1387 = ~Pshh, fine. Spoilsport.~
@1388 = ~Uh. Yes, but that's not...~
@1389 = ~It was a bit over the top, at that. Force of habit. You're a bit smarter than the people I'm used to. (grin)~
@1390 = ~Well, what are we waiting for?~
@1391 = ~What's wrong with outside, exactly?~
@1392 = ~There's dirt, and bugs, and gods know what else!~
@1393 = ~It's just so open. I'm not sure I want to feel that vulnerable.~
@1394 = ~Well--nothing, really. It just surprised me, that's all.~
@1395 = ~So many things, I don't even know where to start.~
@1396 = ~Ah.~
@1397 = ~Well, your loss, I suppose. (shrug)~
@1398 = ~That's a bit harsh. Fine.~
@1399 = ~(shrug) Your loss, I suppose.~
@1400 = ~So is that a yes, or...?~
@1401 = ~I think so, yes. (grin)~
@1402 = ~That's... a no. Sorry.~
@1403 = ~I'll take that as a yes, then. (grin)~
@1404 = ~Hey there, gorgeous. Come here often?~
@1405 = ~Oh, now and then.~
@1406 = ~(grin) This is my first time, actually.~
@1407 = ~... really? That's your line?~
@1408 = ~Oh, gods.~
@1409 = ~Oh, go away.~
@1410 = ~You know, I've never actually got this far with that line before. What happens now?~
@1411 = ~Well, to start with, you invite me to your room... (wink)~
@1412 = ~I've never known anyone dumb enough to use it, so I'm not sure either, to be honest.~
@1413 = ~I would imagine you offer to buy me a drink?~
@1414 = ~I really have no idea, I'm afraid.~
@1415 = ~Heh. Sorry about that. I couldn't resist the opportunity to try it out.~
@1416 = ~(sigh) Fine.~
@1417 = ~Oh, is that how it works? I'm sure we can arrange something to that tune...~
@1418 = ~My room, maybe some reciprocal massage, possibly a little whipped cream...~
@1419 = ~With that in mind, how about we skip dinner and get straight to dessert?~
@1420 = ~Hey, I was talking about it in the theoretical sense! I never said anything about whipped cream!~
@1421 = ~I never said I'd accept your invitation.~
@1422 = ~Nice try, but I don't think so.~
@1423 = ~Ouch! I'm burned, <CHARNAME>. Truly. Someone should call a priest.~
@1424 = ~Well, I can do that. What's your poison, dearest <CHARNAME>? Wine? Ale? Juice? Some bizarre Waterdhavian concoction?~
@1425 = ~Anything as long as it contains plenty of alcohol.~
@1426 = ~An ale would go down great right about now.~
@1427 = ~Surprise me.~
@1428 = ~A glass of one is probably not such a bad idea.~
@1429 = ~Just some juice or water for me, thank you.~
@1430 = ~I couldn't possibly. Thanks, though.~
@1431 = ~Neither do I, heh. How about a drink? What's your poison, dearest <CHARNAME>? Wine? Ale? Juice? Some bizarre Waterdhavian concoction, perhaps?~
@1432 = ~You look a little stressed. I've been told I'm a pretty good masseuse...?~
@1433 = ~Mmm, a massage sounds good.~
@1434 = ~Maybe later... somewhere more private?~
@1435 = ~I think I'll be the judge of that.~
@1436 = ~Not right now, thank you.~
@1437 = ~Mmm... I think I could manage that.~
@1438 = ~Well, you may be, but I'm not. And what's a good sensual massage without something to make it interesting?~
@1439 = ~Alright, I'm in. I've always wanted to try licking whipped cream from someone's stomach...~
@1440 = ~It'a a sensual massage. There's plenty of other things we can do to make it interesting, trust me. (wink)~
@1441 = ~Not tonight, Arath.~
@1442 = ~I'm not interested in you that way, Arath.~
@1443 = ~Well? Will you?~
@1444 = ~Absolutely. (kiss him)~
@1445 = ~Mmm... how about we wait and see?~
@1446 = ~Not tonight. ~
@1447 = ~Well, it was worth a try. Ah well. Your loss. (grin)~
@1448 = ~Heh, I'll see what I can do.~
@1449 = ~I think I saw some Tethyrian rye ale at the bar... I'll see what I can do.~
@1450 = ~Hmmm... alright. How about some Moonshae bloodwhiskey? You know, I'm not sure why it's called that, but... (shrug)~
@1451 = ~I think I saw some aged Chessentan red at the bar... I'll see what I can do.~
@1452 = ~No problem. I'm sure they'll have some apple juice or something along those lines.~
@1453 = ~I'll grab something later on, then.~
@1454 = ~Gods, you're tense. You should relax, stop worrying so much. It'll do you a world of good.~
@1455 = ~You know what, maybe this would be better somewhere a little less public.~
@1456 = ~Hey, I never said anything about whipped cream!~
@1457 = ~Reciprocal? No, no, that won't do.~
@1458 = ~Maybe another time, then.~
@1459 = ~Sleep well, I suppose, I'm heading off. Been a long day.~
@1460 = ~Heh! Now you are a <PRO_MANWOMAN> who knows what <PRO_HESHE> wants. Alright, a massage for you, and... well, we'll see what I get when there, hmm? (wink)~
@1461 = ~Mm, I think I might be able to withstand that... (wink)~
@1462 = ~Sounds good to me, handsome. Shall we? (wink)~
@1463 = ~Sounds good to me, beautiful. Shall we? (wink)~
@1464 = ~Ah. Well, that does throw a damper on things.~
@1465 = ~<CHARNAME>, have you got a moment?~
@1466 = ~You and Anomen have become very close recently. I'm not interested in being the other man, I've been there, I have that t-shirt and it's not an experience I'm going to repeat with you. I respect you too much.~
@1467 = ~You and Aerie have become very close recently. I'm not interested in being the other man, I've been there, I have that t-shirt and it's not an experience I'm going to repeat with you. I respect you too much.~
@1468 = ~You and Jaheira have become very close recently. I'm not interested in being the other man, I've been there, I have that t-shirt and it's not an experience I'm going to repeat with you. I respect you too much.~
@1469 = ~You and Viconia have become very close recently. I'm not interested in being the other man, I've been there, I have that t-shirt and it's not an experience I'm going to repeat with you. I respect you too much.~
@1470 = ~It's been fun, <CHARNAME>. Come on, we've got other things to worry about.~
@1471 = ~The man has a point.~
@1472 = ~Charming. Yes, let's bid on which life is pointlessly lost! Absolutely!~
@1473 = ~You slimy bastard. <CHARNAME> paid you well more than what your services were worth!~
@1474 = ~I hear you. These vampires need to be eradicated before they can grow their numbers even further. Gods know what we'd do then.~
@1475 = ~My family is one of the wealthiest in Athkatla...we have interests in the gold mines up north and the shipwrights here in the city.  So I will thank you not to stand too close..~
@1476 = ~Ahh, Lord Argrim, what a surprise to see you here, of all places? How have you been?~
@1477 = ~Oh! My lord Duskhelm, I hardly recognised you beneath all that paraphernalia. I have had better days, I can assure you.~
@1478 = ~And how are Cecilia and the children?~
@1479 = ~They hardly recognise me with all the work I've been given by the Government. The nerve! My days of working should be far behind me.~
@1480 = ~Ahh, yes, how unfortunate. Well, do say hello.~
@1481 = ~Yes, yes... good day to you.~
@1482 = ~Few do. And with good reason.~
@1483 = ~Is that... what I think it is?~
@1484 = ~He made me... (erf)... remove it. He wouldn't stop screaming...~
@1485 = ~Oookay, enough information for me... ugh...~
@1486 = ~Ye seem awfully familiar... do I know ye?~
@1487 = ~I, uh, I doubt it.~
@1488 = ~Somethin' about yer face... (shrug)~
@1489 = ~Well, it is rather striking.~
@1490 = ~You tell him, my big ugly orc fellow! Throw off your chains of needless oppression! Embrace the light of day as free orcs!~
@1491 = ~... alright, a bit much. Uh.~
@1492 = ~It does, but until the people at the top actually understand what life is like here... it won't.~
@1493 = ~Well, not with that attitude!~
@1494 = ~<CHARNAME>... I don't trust this woman. Something about her is... wrong, somehow.~
@1495 = ~You... do that.~
@1496 = ~What a revolting little man.~
@1497 = ~A kobold?! I'll have you know, you miserable little child, that I have met kobolds, and they're more personable than you will ever grow up to be. Hmph.~
@1498 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, if I were you, I'd trust this guy as far as I could throw him.~
@1499 = ~So ye trust him to about where he be right now, do ye?~
@1500 = ~I'm just saying. Be careful with what you purchase, it might not... you know, work.~
@1501 = ~MY MOTHER SAYS THAT DRUIDS SHOULD GO AND RUTT WITH THE ANIMALS IF THEY LOVE THEM SO MUCH!~
@1502 = ~Right, then. They also like to feed them little girls, so you better be nice!~
@1503 = ~All we had to do was follow the stale trail of blood, vampire. It's time for this to end!~
@1504 = ~Oh yes, it will end... one way or another, my handsome little human. But not so well for you.~
@1505 = ~Huh. You're... smaller than I imagined you. Older, too. Shame.~
@1506 = ~Huh. He's... smaller than I imagined him. Older, too. Shame.~
@1507 = ~What?! The entire city... gone? Just like that?!~
@1508 = ~He's not wrong. The government would have a fit if they ever found out.~
@1509 = ~I never thought I'd be vouching for a drow, but... Viconia has done us no harm. Quite the opposite, in fact. She's been... surprisingly helpful in our endeavors.~
@1510 = ~Then you are more foolish than I thought, pup. She will betray us, it is only a matter of time. It's in her very blood.~
@1511 = ~Yes, yes, the same tired old accusations from the same tired old woman. He was not asking your opinion, waela.~
@1512 = ~Oh gods... what have you done, <CHARNAME>?! You're worse than the Shadow Druids themselves! I can't let you do this!~
@1513 = ~"There once was a druid sore troubled,
whose own father's death had redoubled,
his efforts to top,
the slavers nonstop
and how he has nothing but stubble."~
@1514 = ~How on Faerun did you...~
@1515 = ~Hmm... are you Arath Duskhelm, by any chance? Son of Lord Batthias Duskhelm?~
@1516 = ~Yes? Why?~
@1517 = ~According to my records, sir, you haven't paid taxes in three years. The total amounts to--~
@1518 = ~I haven't lived in Athkatla since I was fourteen. You people should really keep better records.~
@1519 = ~... trust me, if I could make the census staff do their job properly, I would. (sigh)~
@1520 = ~Sorry to bother you.~
@1521 = ~Though I doubt he'll actually make it anywhere near the surface, that was a commendable gesture, <CHARNAME>. Better death on his own terms than... this.~
@1522 = ~I'll... keep that in mind. Just out of curiosity, ah, what *is* a welcher?~
@1523 = ~A welcher's a welcher! Unless you've gold to give!~
@1524 = ~Charming woman.~
@1525 = ~Hmph. The least she could do is a fruit basket. Really.~
@1526 = ~Everything keeps getting more expensive. How am I supposed to feed a family AND buy ale?~
@1527 = ~Get a better job?~
@1528 = ~Easy for you to say.~
@1529 = ~Well hello there, handsome.~
@1530 = ~Uh. Hullo, Charlotte.~
@1531 = ~Care for a tumble, for old times sake? Hmm?~
@1532 = ~Not right now, Lottie. Maybe another time.~
@1533 = ~(sigh) What's a poor woman to do... never get any of the good ones...~
@1534 = ~Ye're a little old to be sportin' hair like that, don't ye think?~
@1535 = ~A good haircut has no age.~
@1536 = ~Keep tellin' yerself that.~
@1537 = ~Oh, dear. So you're going to be one of *those*. It might just be easier to leave this one, <CHARNAME>. Then again, her family might reward us handsomely, so... (shrug)~
@1538 = ~Oh dear, can't let her know you frequent a place as common as this!~
@1539 = ~Indeed, I can hardly imagine her reaction. It would probably involve a fainting spell. (sigh)~
@1540 = ~She does love her fainting spells...~
@1541 = ~Ten thousand gold is no small sum... we should definitely consider this, <CHARNAME>. I really need a new mirror.~
@1542 = ~What's a handsome man like ye doin' in a place like this, eh? Don't ye have nicer places t'be?~
@1543 = ~I'm afraid not. I love how you've done your hair, by the way.~
@1544 = ~Really?~
@1545 = ~Very unique.~
@1546 = ~In a good way, though.~
@1547 = ~Oh!~
@1548 = ~I'm sure she will. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1549 = ~Thank you again!~
@1550 = ~Coward? No. Sensible and devilishly attractive? Yes.~
@1551 = ~Have fun with the death and all.~
@1552 = ~(gasp) How awful! How will you survive?!~
@1553 = ~I hardly know. If things continue to go south, next I won't be able to buy that new gold-plated dresser I've so been longing for!~
@1554 = ~Tragic.~
@1555 = ~<CHARNAME>? I... I saw you fall, and then I felt something *pull* at me...~
@1556 = ~Oh. Ohhh. Sweet merciful gods. I'm dead, aren't I? You pulled me with you when you died. I can't believe you, <CHARNAME>. Honestly!~
@1557 = ~Let's just... get this over with. Whatever it is. And hope someone revives us soon.~
@1558 = ~It's time for this to end, Irenicus! We killed you once, and we'll do it again! Permanently, this time!~
@1559 = ~Arath, the irreverant, complex Athkatlan druid, has promised to see your quest though. But he has a life yet to live, and many accomplishments yet to achieve.~
@1560 = ~You shouldn't risk your life for this, Arath. This is my fight, not yours.~
@1561 = ~You've seen what Irenicus can do. I don't want you to endanger yourself any further on my behalf.~
@1562 = ~Are you sure you're ready for this, Arath? I need you at your best if we're going to win this.~
@1563 = ~Arath: what started as something simple and physical has quickly become much more. He strokes your cheek lightly, waiting for you to continue.~
@1564 = ~Arath... I--~
@1565 = ~You're right, of course. Good luck!~
@1566 = ~Don't be ridiculous, <CHARNAME>. You're not getting rid of me that easily. Let's do this.~
@1567 = ~As ready as I'll ever be to take on a maniacal, all-powerful wizard, absolutely. Let's do this.~
@1568 = ~Hush. I'm with you til the end if need be, <CHARNAME>. I... I'll stand by your side, your proud lover.~
@1569 = ~You've showed me so much in the short time I've known you, and I... I can't ever repay you for that.~
@1570 = ~Then again, you've also put me in mortal danger more times than I can count, so I guess it evens out in the end. (wink)~
@1571 = ~Come on. Let's do this.~
@1572 = ~Merciful gods.~
@1573 = ~Are you telling me... actually, I'm not sure I want to think about that. (shudder)~
@1574 = ~So you... how sad. I almost feel sorry for you.~
@1575 = ~What a despicable speck of a man. No, he doesn't even deserve to be a speck of a man. No child should suffer that.~
@1576 = ~That's ridiculous. Why would druids attack Trademeet?~
@1577 = ~You!  Have you ever been cheated, here?  I bet ye have!~
@1578 = ~Ah, that would be a no, I'm afraid. There was this one time across town where I was charged a few gold more than I should have, but it was more a convenience fee than anything else. And the fact that I accidentally broke the merchant's nose. A bit.~
@1579 = ~Your friend is quite the handsome one, isn't he? My, I have been without entertainment lately... perhaps I could interest him in a position with my house staff?~
@1580 = ~As appealing as it is to go back into noble captivity, I'm afraid I have to decline.~
@1581 = ~Well... if you ever change your mind.~
@1582 = ~Not even if it was that or being violated with a cactus.~
@1583 = ~My word!~
@1584 = ~Now I could let you in on some delicious secrets of some of the most powerful men in Athkatla...but that would be telling, wouldn't it?~
@1585 = ~Lady Oriona. A pleasure.~
@1586 = ~Hmmm... now where do I know you from? You look terribly familiar...~
@1587 = ~I only know you by reputation, I assure you. And while I'm sure you have many of Athkat's more... delectable morsels of gossip, from what I hear you've a fair amount whispered about you as well.~
@1588 = ~Lies and aspersions, all of it!~
@1589 = ~I'm sure.~
@1590 = ~Dead, as you'll soon be if you don't watch yourself. You can't just kill girls you're unhappy with! Apart from the fact you'll quickly run out of them in a place like this, it's just not done.~
@1591 = ~I... wow. I can't believe he'd do that to us! We played cards! He taught me how to cheat at it! And now he goes and cheats us?!~
@1592 = ~Uh, <CHARNAME>? You don't look so great... if you're going to faint or something, let me know, okay? That way I can dramatically catch you in my arms and sweep you up in a romantic kiss.~
@1593 = ~I'm fine. Let's keep moving.~
@1594 = ~I'm just feeling a bit dizzy, that's all. Nothing to worry about.~
@1595 = ~I did just have my soul torn out, so there's that.~
@1596 = ~If you say so. You will tell me though, right? I don't want to miss an opportunity!~
@1597 = ~Point taken. You will tell me though, right? I don't want to miss an opportunity!~
@1598 = ~I don't mean to alarm you or anything, <CHARNAME>, but what the hells was that?! I really hope it was just some kind of obscure party trick... please let it be an obscure party trick.~
@1599 = ~It's not a party trick, is it. (sigh)~
@1600 = ~<CHARNAME>? I wasn't kidding with the catching thing. You know what, maybe I'll just... I'll be right here, okay?~
@1601 = ~I'm feeling... really strange. Maybe it's best if you--~
@1602 = ~I'd appreciate that. Oh, Arath--~
@1603 = ~Will you hold me, Arath? I just feel...~
@1604 = ~Okay. Okay. Don't freak out. Stay calm. Deep breaths. In, out. In, out.~
@1605 = ~This isn't working. I just--I need some fresh air. Godsdamnit, why can't we be somewhere normal for once?!~
@1606 = ~Arath? Can you calm down, please? You're not the only one who needs some air!~
@1607 = ~Nothing about me is normal. You knew that. I told you.~
@1608 = ~Have a bit of compassion, please?!~
@1609 = ~I need you to be focused right now. You need to snap out of it.~
@1610 = ~Calm down?! You just... you just turned into some giant bloody death monster with claws! How do you expect me to be *calm*? You almost killed me!~
@1611 = ~You didn't tell me you'd soon be turning into some giant bloody death monster with claws! You almost killed me, <CHARNAME>!~
@1612 = ~Compassion?! You just turned into some giant bloody death monster with claws! Compassion is not what I should be feeling right now! You almost killed me!~
@1613 = ~Okay. I just--this is a lot to handle right now. Sorry for shouting at you. Let's... let's just keep going.~
@1614 = ~Trust me, you'd think differently if you knew what went on behind closed doors here.~
@1615 = ~That is disturbing on... so many levels.~
@1616 = ~<CHARNAME>? I know this is... hard for you, but you need to consider--look. Just... take it easy with her, okay? Who knows what that mage has done to her.~
@1617 = ~You're going to pay for what you did to <CHARNAME>, you bastard!~
@1618 = ~Well, you're not doing a terribly good job at being an ally!~
@1619 = ~This is just kind of... sad. I had no idea something like this could happen, but... I guess it makes sense.~
@1620 = ~It's alright, we feel suitably terrified. Or I do, at least. Pants are wet and everything.~
@1621 = ~Excellent.~
@1622 = ~Sahuagin. I've read about them before... humanoids that are sort of a cross between a fish and a reptile. Except, you know, intelligent and deadly. I have to admit, though, I didn't know they... you know, spoke, had their own language.~
@1623 = ~You're not, ah, really my type, I'm afraid. What with being... a man, and all.~
@1624 = ~I may not be much of a maiden, Salvanas, but I'll give you one hell of a ride. (wink)~
@1625 = ~Ah... no thanks. (gulp)~
@1626 = ~Apple blossom elven wine? I've heard that's very hard to come by...~
@1627 = ~Yes, it is. Which is why I want to keep it out of your grubby hands.~
@1628 = ~Ah. No offense meant.~
@1629 = ~None taken. If I had any, I'd feel much the same way!~
@1630 = ~Gods. Severed? But...~
@1631 = ~This is starting to make sense. And I'm not sure if either side is right. What you did to him...~
@1632 = ~Well, I can't say I didn't see that coming. Well, maybe not the whole god thing, but... the whole seeking-power-for-himself thing. I guess divinity is about as much power as you could ever hope for, so...~
@1633 = ~They *buried you alive*? Nice. Really nice.~
@1634 = ~Ah. They've got enough land of their own. Trust me. And your land is, well, kind of populated. Not what druids generally go for.~
@1635 = ~Good. You deserved whatever they did to you, and worse. Bastard.~
@1636 = ~You're insane. You cannot be listening to this, <CHARNAME>. He'll destroy the entire grove!~
@1637 = ~The actions of your past haunt you, despite your attempts to forget. In order to move forward, you must come to terms with yourself, your actions and your inner conflicts.~
@1638 = ~I... thank you, I guess. But I'm not sure if I *have* any deep inner conflicts, really. I mean, apart from my indecision over whether I like strawberries or blueberries more.~
@1639 = ~I think I like this one, <CHARNAME>. She's definitely got a mouth on her, that's for sure. (grin)~
@1640 = ~(whisper) "Welcome to Ust Natha! We hope you have a wonderful time here. Don't forget to check out the hot springs and famous culinary delights while you're here!"~
@1641 = ~You follow in the hopes of retrieving something dear to you. I say that the longer you keep this up, the more you will lose.~
@1642 = ~Take handsome Arath here. From what I understand, the two of you have developed quite the relationship since I last saw you. It's so difficult when you lose someone dear to you, isn't it?~
@1643 = ~<CHARNAME>, what is she--~
@1644 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and stealing from me the one person that is dearest to my heart: Arath.  Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi warned me that if I continue I will lose even more than I thought possible.  I cannot give up on the Rhynn Lanthorn... but now the life and immortal soul of Arath is at stake, as well!~
@1645 = ~But... no, I have already prepared much for this meeting, <CHARNAME>. I did warn you that you would suffer great loss if you continued your push towards me.  I did not lie.~
@1646 = ~You have taken too much already!  You will return both Imoen's soul and Arath!~
@1647 = ~And you have delivered on that promise.  Return Arath and perhaps I will be merciful.~
@1648 = ~I would have hunted you for your theft of Arath alone.  He is very important to me.~
@1649 = ~You place too much confidence in sentiment.  The theft of Arath will not save you.~
@1650 = ~He is lost to you, <CHARNAME>.  Arath was quite receptive to my discipline.  I doubt your fumbling could have inspired the loyalty I have taken with a bite and a gaze.~
@1651 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi has turned Arath into a vampire!  Or... or very nearly.  The process may not have been completed in the short time Bodhi has had him.  Hopefully something can be done or I will have lost him.  Perhaps the elven war sage might know some way of restoration... or Elhan...~
@1652 = ~An interesting ploy, though I am sure his fate will still serve as an example, whether you wish her back or not.~
@1653 = ~As you wish, Mistress Bodhi.~
@1654 = ~Don't you see, <CHARNAME>?  He is not even fully turned and he has betrayed you.  Prepare to die at your lover's hand!~
@1655 = ~Elhan!  I've the half vampire body of Arath here because of you!  You'll tell me now!~
@1656 = ~A friend is afflicted by vampirism.  An old book suggested that followers of Oghma might know something about that.~
@1657 = ~I'm looking for information about a tome that details the curing of Vampirism.~
@1658 = ~Have you come seeking wisdom from the Binder of What is Known? The Wise God stands ready.~
@1659 = ~No, thank you, I have no need of help at the moment.~
@1660 = ~I lost a dear one in a battle with his sister, Bodhi.  I seek a means of curing him.~
@1661 = ~A dear one was taken by a vampire. What can I expect when I find him?~
@1662 = ~Someone I care about has fallen to a vampire. Is there any way to save him?~
@1663 = ~Are you Arath Duskhelm?~
@1664 = ~I have a message for you from Archdruid Wreimasss. She requests your presence at the Druid Grove outside of Trademeet. She has an important task for you.~
@1665 = ~She didn't happen to tell you what that task was, did she?~
@1666 = ~No sir, that was the message in full.~
@1667 = ~Thank you.~
@1668 = ~<CHARNAME>? I wouldn't ask if I didn't think it was important.~
@1669 = ~We can spare some time. We'll go there now.~
@1670 = ~We're a little busy right now, can it wait a few days?~
@1671 = ~Can't you deal with this yourself?~
@1672 = ~We're too busy for this, Arath.~
@1673 = ~Good. We may as well get it out of the way sooner rather than later.~
@1674 = ~As I recall, the Archdruid doesn't mind waiting... I've heard stories she waited twenty years for a flower to bloom, once. Still, she wouldn't have sent someone if it wasn't urgent, so we shouldn't keep her waiting too long.~
@1675 = ~Mining for Trouble

We received a message from the Archdruid of Arath's grove asking to meet us at the Druid Grove outside of Trademeet. Arath mentioned it must be relatively urgent for the Archdruid to send a messenger.~
@1676 = ~I suppose. I mean, I'd rather not, but...~
@1677 = ~I would prefer if you could go by yourself. We can spare you for a few days.~
@1678 = ~Fine, we'll go do it now.~
@1679 = ~Alright. We'll do it as soon as we can.~
@1680 = ~If you won't go with me, I'll have to go myself. She's the Archdruid, I can't just ignore her summons.~
@1681 = ~Then that's what you're going to have to do.~
@1682 = ~Deal with your own problems.~
@1683 = ~Fine. If you change your mind, I'll be outside the Druid Grove nearby Trademeet.~
@1684 = ~I know you had no obligation to help me, but this is a low move, <CHARNAME>.~
@1685 = ~Be seeing you.~
@1686 = ~Mining for Trouble

We received a message from the Archdruid of Arath's grove asking to meet us at the Druid Grove outside of Trademeet. Arath mentioned it must be relatively urgent for the Archdruid to send a messenger. I told him to handle it himself. He said he would be waiting at the Druid Grove if I changed my mind.~
@1687 = ~I don't mean to bug you, <CHARNAME>, but it's been a while. We should really go and talk to the Archdruid at the grove.~
@1688 = ~I can only wait so long. I'll go by myself if I have to.~
@1689 = ~You won't. We're going now.~
@1690 = ~I haven't forgotten. We're going soon.~
@1691 = ~You might have to.~
@1692 = ~I'd appreciate it. She wouldn't have sent a messenger if it wasn't urgent.~
@1693 = ~Sooner is better. She wouldn't have sent a messenger if it wasn't urgent.~
@1694 = ~I have to go to the grove. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but you've ignored my repeated requests, so...~
@1695 = ~Mining for Trouble

Arath has left, I assume to deal with his grove's problem on his own. He mentioned that if I wanted to help, he could be found at the Druid Grove.~
@1696 = ~Arath! You're late.~
@1697 = ~(sigh) Yes, Archdruid.~
@1698 = ~We've got something of a situation developing at home.~
@1699 = ~A... situation? What do you mean?~
@1700 = ~The grove is dying.~
@1701 = ~The grove is--what? How could it be dying? It's a blessed grove!~
@1702 = ~Something is going on nearby, in one of the abandoned mines. It's no longer abandoned, I'm afraid.~
@1703 = ~Gods. The quicksilver mines.~
@1704 = ~Yes. Sometimes I wonder how you ever passed the rites, boy.~
@1705 = ~It's a mystery to us all. Alright. What do you want me--us--to do?~
@1706 = ~Your friends. Can they be trusted?~
@1707 = ~Yes.~
@1708 = ~This is <CHARNAME>. <PRO_HESHE> is the leader of our group.~
@1709 = ~Can you be trusted?~
@1710 = ~I'd like to think so.~
@1711 = ~Absolutely not, in my experience.~
@1712 = ~Just tell me what you want us to do.~
@1713 = ~Do I look like I can be trusted?~
@1714 = ~I'm waiting for someone. Excuse me.~
@1715 = ~I suppose we don't have much choice in the matter, in any case.~
@1716 = ~I suppose you'll have to do. We don't have much choice.~
@1717 = ~I'll be short with you. Our grove is being poisoned by a local mining operation. We need it stopped, or our grove may die.~
@1718 = ~Who's behind the operation?~
@1719 = ~How is it being poisoned?~
@1720 = ~What about payment?~
@1721 = ~Why should I care?~
@1722 = ~What do you want us to do?~
@1723 = ~I'm not a fortuneteller, I'm a druid. All I know is that it's a mine, and our grove is gravely ill.~
@1724 = ~We're not sure. It's not the mining itself, it's whatever they do to what they mine after it's been mined. It's draining into our creeks.~
@1725 = ~Payment?~
@1726 = ~Fine. You will be... rewarded for your time.~
@1727 = ~Because it is the right thing to do, and because thousands of creatures and plants including some that are many thousands of years old will die if you do not.~
@1728 = ~Arath, I am not accustomed to this questioning. Who is this insolent child to speak to me this way?~
@1729 = ~Find out who is behind this travesty and put a stop to it.~
@1730 = ~There are many abandoned mines nearby! It could be any of them. Your job is to find it and put a stop to it.~
@1731 = ~We have a contact in Athkatla who may know the location, or at least be able to put you on the right track. Find him in the Copper Coronet.~
@1732 = ~It's... a long story, Archdruid.~
@1733 = ~I'm sure it is. They usually are with you.~
@1734 = ~Did you have any further questions?~
@1735 = ~And how do you propose we do that, Archdruid? Knock on their door and ask them to keep it down because the kids are trying to sleep?~
@1736 = ~If that will get the job done. Deal with it however you like.~
@1737 = ~There is one minor problem, however. We do not know exactly where the mine is located.~
@1738 = ~You don't know where the mine *is*? How do you expect me to stop them, then?~
@1739 = ~How can I find out?~
@1740 = ~Fat lot of help you are!~
@1741 = ~By which I'm sure <CHARNAME> meant, how do you suggest we locate the mine?~
@1742 = ~Hmph. Yes, I am *sure* that is what <PRO_HESHE> meant.~
@1743 = ~Does this contact have a name, o wise one?~
@1744 = ~You may have passed the rites, whelpling, but that does not give you the right to ridicule your betters.~
@1745 = ~Ah... yes, ma'am.~
@1746 = ~His name is Hendak. I believe you have met him before.~
@1747 = ~Met him? We helped him escape!~
@1748 = ~I seem to recall that was mentioned. He has proved an excellent source of information on the more... shady side of Athkatla to many. You are to be commended.~
@1749 = ~I try.~
@1750 = ~I hate to interrupt your little catchup session, but was there anything else?~
@1751 = ~I'd like to point out that it was me who killed Lehtinan and freed the slaves, not Arath.~
@1752 = ~Was there anything else we need to know?~
@1753 = ~Hendak believes it to be an illegal mining operation.~
@1754 = ~An illegal mining operation? But--~
@1755 = ~I do not know anything further. Question Hendak, not me.~
@1756 = ~Thank you, Archdruid. We'll see what we can do.~
@1757 = ~You know, sometimes I miss your face around the grove. Then I see you for five minutes and remember why you left.~
@1758 = ~Thanks, Ellen. Appreciated.~
@1759 = ~Anytime, dear.~
@1760 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>, let's get out of here. We've got a mine to shut down, apparently.~
@1761 = ~Mining for Trouble

We have met with the Archdruid, who has tasked us with investigating what she believes to be an illegal mining operation that is poisoning the grove. She suggested we speak with Hendak in Athkatla to find out more.~
@1762 = ~<CHARNAME> helped.~
@1763 = ~Yes, I'm sure.~
@1764 = ~There is one last thing.~
@1765 = ~I'm sorry you had to get dragged into taking care of my responsibilities.~
@1766 = ~And for Wreimass. She's a pain, but she's a good Archdruid, and she means well. She's just a bit... hard to warm up to.~
@1767 = ~Don't worry about it, Arath.~
@1768 = ~She's a cow. I don't know how you could put up with her.~
@1769 = ~You owe me for this, Arath.~
@1770 = ~Come on. Let's get this done.~
@1771 = ~I think she liked you, personally. She's usually far more abrupt.~
@1772 = ~Oh, I don't know if I would...~
@1773 = ~Yeah, okay, she's a cow. But that's not all she is.~
@1774 = ~The list of things I owe you for is becoming uncomfortably long. Ugh.~
@1775 = ~Alright. Hendak awaits. Let's not keep him waiting too long.~
@1776 = ~Hendak, we were sent by Archdruid Wreimass. What can you tell us?~
@1777 = ~What happened to the building the slavers worked out of, Hendak? I'd like a little warning if I'm going to meet opposition there.~
@1778 = ~I've come across a store of quicksilver. Would you be interested in helping me sell it?~
@1779 = ~I've come across a store of quicksilver. I want to give it to you. You can sell it and use the funds to continue helping the people here.~
@1780 = ~Since you helped us to escape Lehtinan's grasp and take the Coronet, I have done my best to keep my ear to the ground in the hope that I could monitor the slave trade here in Athkatla. They have kept very quiet, suspiciously so, until several weeks ago.~
@1781 = ~What happened several weeks ago?~
@1782 = ~How does this relate to the poisoned grove?~
@1783 = ~What do you mean, you've kept your ear to the ground?~
@1784 = ~Just tell me what I need to know.~
@1785 = ~Three weeks ago, several large, unidentified ships passed through the docks. The authorities seemed to ignore it as it nothing happened, but my sources tell me there was human cargo aboard.~
@1786 = ~From what I can piece together, a large amount of slaves were shipped into Athkatla. The next day, they were no longer here.~
@1787 = ~What happened to them?~
@1788 = ~How do you know?~
@1789 = ~Where did they go?~
@1790 = ~And what does this have to do with the grove, exactly?~
@1791 = ~Since I took over here, I have spent a great deal of effort to learn who to talk to and what to ask. The gold that lined Lehtinan's chests helped.~
@1792 = ~I am not exactly sure where they went, but I have my suspicions.~
@1793 = ~How does this fit in with the poisoning of the druid grove?~
@1794 = ~What do you think happened?~
@1795 = ~Who do I need to kill this time?~
@1796 = ~Officially, they never existed, but everywhere I had my sources look was empty. Not every place was checked, but... I am certain. They are no longer within Athkatlan walls.~
@1797 = ~So where are they, then?~
@1798 = ~Any idea what might have happened~
@1799 = ~Just tell me who I need to kill this time.~
@1800 = ~I suspect these slaves have been taken to work at the mine the Archdruid is so worried about. I thought they were unrelated incidents in the beginning, but...~
@1801 = ~The more I think on it, the more sense it seems to make. The two events must be linked.~
@1802 = ~What do you suggest I do?~
@1803 = ~Who do you think is behind it?~
@1804 = ~Sounds unlikely to me.~
@1805 = ~Hah! I admire your zeal, <CHARNAME>. It reminds me of myself, many years ago.~
@1806 = ~What you do is your choice, but I would start by talking to Magistrate Bylanna. If there is an illegal mining operation run by slavers nearby, she might know something. The Athkatlan guard may be conveniently deaf and dumb at certain times, but stupid they are not.~
@1807 = ~Thank you, Hendak.~
@1808 = ~Was there anything else?~
@1809 = ~I'll let you know if I find anything.~
@1810 = ~I do not know, my friend. It must be someone with power here in Athkatla; no mere peasant could make the Athkatlan Guard turn a blind eye.~
@1811 = ~Unlikely it may be, but it is remarkably coincidental. I may be wrong, but I do not think so.~
@1812 = ~Nay, my friend, it is thanks to you that I am alive today. You are the one who deserves thanks. Good luck.~
@1813 = ~Mining for Trouble

We have spoken with Hendak, who has informed us a shipment of slaves came into Athkatla three weeks ago. He believes these slaves may have been taken to work at the mine polluting the grove. He suggested we speak with Magistrate Bylanna in the Government district, saying that if there was an illegal mining operation occuring, she might know something useful.~
@1814 = ~That is all I have, I am afraid. Good luck.~
@1815 = ~I would appreciate it. Good luck.~
@1816 = ~Good luck.~
@1817 = ~Quicksilver? That may be a little difficult to find buyers for, but... I shall see what I can do. I will contact you when it has been sold with a good share of the profit.~
@1818 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1819 = ~Quicksilver? That may be a little difficult to find buyers for, but... I shall see what I can do. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. The money will go to good use.~
@1820 = ~There has been no activity there, if that's what you are trying to discover. Though it has been useful to leave certain channels open, I will not deal with slavers.~
@1821 = ~Thank you for letting me know, <CHARNAME>. I wish you the best of luck in finding something of use.~
@1822 = ~We investigated the old slaver stockade and found these documents, detailing an operation much like the one we're facing.~
@1823 = ~Have you heard anything about an illegal mining operation running nearby?~
@1824 = ~In my investigation of the slave ring I came across a stockpile of quicksilver in the old slaver warehouse.~
@1825 = ~We've shut down the mine, and killed the slavers. It's over.~
@1826 = ~How did you know about that? Where did you get that information?~
@1827 = ~I'm an adventurer. It's my job to know these things, ma'am.~
@1828 = ~I've been tasked by a local Archdruid to stop it.~
@1829 = ~I have heard rumors about it.~
@1830 = ~Hendak in the Copper Coronet mentioned it.~
@1831 = ~I see.~
@1832 = ~There have indeed been reports of an illegal mining operation running nearby Athkatlan walls. I have been told it is related to an influx of quicksilver into the black market here.~
@1833 = ~What do you know about it? I have had several of my people attempt to ascertain its location, but none have been successful.~
@1834 = ~I was hoping you would be able to tell me.~
@1835 = ~I don't know any more than you do.~
@1836 = ~Aren't you people supposed to be intelligence experts?~
@1837 = ~I know it is being run by slavers, if that helps.~
@1838 = ~Hm. I shall have to have him watched. Someone with this sort of information cannot have gained it through legal means.~
@1839 = ~As I recall, you were involved in the death of Lehtinan, original proprietor of the Copper Coronet and local slaver. Despite what I imagine to be your good intent, in killing him you have caused us any number of troubles.~
@1840 = ~Lehtinan was far too confident, and often let slip extremely useful intelligence on the Shadow Thieves, the local slave trade and much more.~
@1841 = ~With his death, you removed that source, and we must now attempt to deal with less than honorable types in order to discover that which we need to know.~
@1842 = ~I am afraid I cannot help you. There is nothing I can tell you other than what I am sure you already know. However... I do have a suggestion.~
@1843 = ~What is it you suggest?~
@1844 = ~Oh gods, here we go.~
@1845 = ~I don't need your suggestions.~
@1846 = ~That does not surprise me, though it was not something I knew. Thank you.~
@1847 = ~You were the one who destroyed the slaver ring Lehtinan was involved with. You may have access to their original base of operations, and most importantly, their records.~
@1848 = ~I would send men of my own, but... Perhaps you should return there, and determine if this new situation is related in some way to the previous one.~
@1849 = ~Report to me if you discover anything.~
@1850 = ~I will as soon as I do.~
@1851 = ~And vice versa, please.~
@1852 = ~Not bloody likely.~
@1853 = ~You would do well to listen to me, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. I have had many more years of experience at this than you.~
@1854 = ~Excellent. Now, I have other things to attend to. Excuse me.~
@1855 = ~Because I am a magistrate, and I have overlooked many of your transgressions during your time here in Amn. You owe me this much.~
@1856 = ~That is your prerogative, but you would do well to have a friend here, <CHARNAME>. I have overlooked many of your transgressions during your time here in Amn, but if you do not cooperate, that may change.~
@1857 = ~Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other things to attend to.~
@1858 = ~Mining for Trouble

Unfortunately Bylanna did not know anything much about the mining operation, except to confirm that it existed and was being investigated. Given our initial destruction of the slavers in Athkatla, she has tasked us to return to the slaver stockade to see if we can find anything useful, and report back once we have done so.~
@1859 = ~Thank you for bringing it to my attention. I will ensure it gets confiscated and dealt with appropriately.~
@1860 = ~Anything I can do to help.~
@1861 = ~Is there anything new you've discovered about the case?~
@1862 = ~Where's my reward?~
@1863 = ~Excuse me.~
@1864 = ~Reward? This is government business, <CHARNAME>. There are no rewards.~
@1865 = ~Then I will take the quicksilver elsewhere.~
@1866 = ~That's... disappointing, to say the least.~
@1867 = ~Fine. Well, I'm glad I could help.~
@1868 = ~Nothing new, I'm afraid. Excuse me.~
@1869 = ~Do that and you will regret it.~
@1870 = ~Fine. You take it.~
@1871 = ~I'm quaking in my stylish yet affordable boots.~
@1872 = ~I'll live.~
@1873 = ~We must all endure disappointments. Excuse me.~
@1874 = ~Excellent choice. Excuse me.~
@1875 = ~You will get no help from us in the future, <CHARNAME>. I am watching you.~
@1876 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for your aid in this matter. I have put together a small reward for you and your group as payment, and I will do my best to keep you out of the courts while you continue your quest.~
@1877 = ~All the same, I would appreciate you staying out of trouble. The paperwork is... painful.~
@1878 = ~Thank you, Magistrate.~
@1879 = ~I'll do my best to stay out of trouble.~
@1880 = ~Me? Stay out of trouble? Hardly.~
@1881 = ~Off with you. This building is crowded enough as it is without a group of fully equipped adventurers traipsing the halls.~
@1882 = ~(sigh) Just keep it to a minimum.~
@1883 = ~Hmm... thank you, <CHARNAME>. These will prove most useful.~
@1884 = ~Scouts have found what they believe to be the location of the mine, not far from the Trademeet grove. Initial reports suggest it is a relatively small operation, merceneries, that sort of thing. You should have no trouble taking it out. I have assigned an agent, who will meet you at the entrance to the grove. He will direct you from there.~
@1885 = ~Thank you, Magistrate. We will go immediately.~
@1886 = ~You could mark it on our map?~
@1887 = ~And what if I say no?~
@1888 = ~The sooner this is resolved, the better. Good luck.~
@1889 = ~Mining for Trouble

While we investigated the old slaver stockade, Bylanna's agents found the location of the mine. She has sent a guide to take us there; we are to meet him near the entrance of the Trademeet Druid Grove.~
@1890 = ~The swamp surrounding the druid grove is difficult at best to navigate. I would prefer you did not get lost for weeks in the process of trying to find the mine; I'm not sure we have the resources to arrange a search and rescue right now.~
@1891 = ~You've come this far. To stop now would be... impractical.~
@1892 = ~You must be <CHARNAME>? Hi, I'm Tomas, and I'll be your guide through the jungle today!~
@1893 = ~Just a bit of humor there. You know. Ice-breaker, and all that. Alright. Are you ready to get going? It's a bit of a hike, so make sure you've got enough water.~
@1894 = ~Nice to, uh, meet you.~
@1895 = ~I'm not quite ready yet.~
@1896 = ~Just this way... watch those giant mushrooms, they're not weight-bearing mushrooms like you might be used to!~
@1897 = ~Just let me know when you're ready to go!~
@1898 = ~And you! It's not often I get to go out to the field, being more of a scientist than anything else, a biologist, some might say, so this is terribly exciting!~
@1899 = ~Did you want to head off, or wait a little?~
@1900 = ~We're ready if you are.~
@1901 = ~Give us a moment, please.~
@1902 = ~Well, here we are. Sorry about the bugs, not much we can do about that--I did manage to catch some fascinating specimens, however!~
@1903 = ~Good for you. Thanks for the help.~
@1904 = ~Right. Well, enjoy that.~
@1905 = ~I'm going to get moving.~
@1906 = ~You're an exceedingly strange man.~
@1907 = ~Anytime! Literally, just ask for me at the bureau. It might take me a while, sometimes I get distracted, but I'll be there!~
@1908 = ~Don't worry, I will! Just wait 'til my colleagues find out I found a yellow-winged gasbeetle!~
@1909 = ~Best of luck! And if you ever need my services, just ask for me at the bureau. It might take me a while, sometimes I get distracted, but I'll be there!~
@1910 = ~I get that a lot.~
@1911 = ~I'll leave you to it, I'm sure you can find your way back. Best of luck!~
@1912 = ~There has to be something here...~
@1913 = ~I should have known. My father's work.~
@1914 = ~<CHARNAME>, he planned the operation. The slaves, the mine... he must have planned it years ago. Before his death. And someone is enacting it.~
@1915 = ~Godsdamnit! I thought I had escaped the shadow of his idiocy when we killed the slavers last time! How does he keep following me?!~
@1916 = ~Calm down. There's no point in getting angry about it. We have to work out what to do next.~
@1917 = ~Sometimes the legacy of our fathers haunts us in ways even do don't understand.~
@1918 = ~We don't have time for this. What do the plans say?~
@1919 = ~Apparently even beyond the grave!~
@1920 = ~Okay. I just need a minute.~
@1921 = ~There's hundreds of pages of notes here, detailed plans and fallbacks for every move he intended to make. They're mining raw quicksilver. Hells...~
@1922 = ~We've got to fix this, <CHARNAME>. And we've got to do it soon.~
@1923 = ~Is there anything else?~
@1924 = ~Why should I care about your stupid grove, anyway?~
@1925 = ~I'm sorry about this, Arath. This can't be easy.~
@1926 = ~<CHARNAME>, they were stockpiling quicksilver here. In this building. I'm not sure where, but... there's a note here. The handwriting isn't my father's.~
@1927 = ~We should tell somebody. Bylanna, perhaps. Or... we could sell it. Give it to Hendak. I don't know.~
@1928 = ~We need to go see Bylanna. Now. If this has been going on for weeks... <CHARNAME>, the grove won't last much longer.~
@1929 = ~We'll go right now.~
@1930 = ~We'll go as soon as we can.~
@1931 = ~Deal with it yourself. This quicksilver is reward enough for me.~
@1932 = ~Because--I don't know, because I do!~
@1933 = ~Wait... hang on.~
@1934 = ~Let's not do this right now, okay?~
@1935 = ~Good. These bastards need to pay.~
@1936 = ~Mining for Trouble

Investigating the old slaver stockade indeed proved useful. Amongst his father's old documents, Arath found plans for illegal mining operation that he is certain is the one being used. In addition to vital information about the operation, it includes the location of a horde of quicksilver hidden in the stockade. I should tell Bylanna, or see if Hendak is interested in buying it.~
@1937 = ~You bastard. You utter bastard.~
@1938 = ~Rot in hell.~
@1939 = ~Mining for Trouble

I told Arath he could deal with his problems himself, after discovering a horde of quicksilver hidden in the slaver stockade. I should see if Hendak is interested in buying it.~
@1940 = ~What are ye doin' in here?! Ye ain't allowed in the mine!~
@1941 = ~You! You've got to help me, they've--~
@1942 = ~Shut yer trap, ye godsfersaken rat!~
@1943 = ~Hells, now you've gone and done it! Get them! They can't get away!~
@1944 = ~Thank you! You've no idea what they're...~
@1945 = ~The others! You've got to help the others! They're down the mine!~
@1946 = ~Tell them to escape if they get the opportunity. We'll take the slavers.~
@1947 = ~Tell them to fight. We need all the help we're going to get.~
@1948 = ~You should escape while you can.~
@1949 = ~Die, slave! If you couldn't escape, you don't deserve to live!~
@1950 = ~G-go back down there? Yes, I... I must. Thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I will tell them.~
@1951 = ~Get the others out! You have to help them!~
@1952 = ~Gods, no! Please! Have mercy!~
@1953 = ~Run away, little man. Run away like the rodent you are.~
@1954 = ~Prepare to meet your god!~
@1955 = ~Gods curse you!~
@1956 = ~What in the hells do you think you're doing, <CHARNAME>?! If you attack this man, you'll have to fight me as well!~
@1957 = ~What do you think you're doing?! This man is innocent!~
@1958 = ~You can't be serious, little <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>! What has this man done to you?~
@1959 = ~And I. This is a travesty, <CHARNAME>, and I will not let you enact it!~
@1960 = ~Attack this man, <CHARNAME>, and Arath is not the only problem you will encounter.~
@1961 = ~Y-you cannot do this, <CHARNAME>! I won't let you!~
@1962 = ~Do this and I *will* stand against you!~
@1963 = ~I will not let this evil occur! Attack this man and you will face my wrath!~
@1964 = ~This is wrong. I will defend this man if I have to.~
@1965 = ~Nay, <CHARNAME>, you cannot kill this man! Boo will have none of it!~
@1966 = ~Fine, fine! I was joking. It was a joke.~
@1967 = ~Then you will go down with him!~
@1968 = ~In very poor taste. That man did nothing to you, and you treat him like garbage. You should be ashamed of yourself.~
@1969 = ~Then defend yourself!~
@1970 = ~I should have known this idiocy was your fault. Your father's son, through and through.~
@1971 = ~Hardly. Your little operation is over, you ugly cretin!~
@1972 = ~Har har! That's not what your mother said!~
@1973 = ~Oh, give it up, Haftmund. You can't goad me with your petty insults. My mother was a whore and we both know it.~
@1974 = ~We certainly do, don't we, Arath.~
@1975 = ~Look at what you've reduced me to. Hiding down mines, harrying slaves for quicksilver. Pfah. Your cockroach of a father would be proud.~
@1976 = ~Somehow, I doubt that. And I didn't do this to you--you did.~
@1977 = ~So you really think... you're a fool through and through.~
@1978 = ~Let's skip the pleasantries. We've won, and you need to die.~
@1979 = ~Haha! The peacock has talons!~
@1980 = ~He's got a lot more than that, you bastard!~
@1981 = ~Stop! Stop! I yield!~
@1982 = ~You deserve no mercy, slaver!~
@1983 = ~I have information! If I die, it goes with me!~
@1984 = ~I don't care! No good has ever come from your mouth!~
@1985 = ~Whatever you have to say better be good, slaver.~
@1986 = ~What's in it for me?~
@1987 = ~If Arath doesn't care what you have to say, neither do I!~
@1988 = ~Die, slaver scum!~
@1989 = ~Do you really think one man could bring down an entire ring, boy? Did you really think *you* stopped us?~
@1990 = ~I thought--~
@1991 = ~You're an idiot. Your father laid the seeds for our destruction years ago. He planned it, he must have, because the defections that day were staggering. The locks on the cages were broken. You had very little to do with it at all.~
@1992 = ~My father is dead, Haftmund, don't--~
@1993 = ~Of course he's dead, you stupid boy! I watched him die! No, he planned our fall long before I poisoned him. Didn't you ever wonder, or did you really just think you were that powerful? A one-man army, who took down an entire ring of slavers?~
@1994 = ~That's what I thought. You're pathetic.~
@1995 = ~Mining for Trouble

We confronted the slavers in the mine, and encountered an old "friend" of Arath's fathers, who in exchange for his life told Arath that his father was not who Arath thought he was. Once the mine is clear, we should return to the Druid Grove and speak to Archdruid Wreimass.~
@1996 = ~I submitted! I yielded, you idiots!~
@1997 = ~Do it quickly, then. DO IT!~
@1998 = ~Mining for Trouble

We confronted the slavers in the mine, and encountered an old "friend" of Arath's fathers, who attacked us. Once the mine is clear, we should return to the Druid Grove and speak to Archdruid Wreimass.~
@1999 = ~Nothing, but for him...~
@2000 = ~Not good enough. Prepare to die!~
@2001 = ~Fine. Whatever it is better be good.~
@2002 = ~Make it quick.~
@2003 = ~I don't want to... let's just not talk right now, okay?~
@2004 = ~We need to tell Wreimass. And Magistrate Bylanna. They'll want to know the slavers have been taken down.~
@2005 = ~Arath? Is it done?~
@2006 = ~It's done. We killed the slavers, the mine won't be running any longer.~
@2007 = ~Good. Took you long enough.~
@2008 = ~"Took you long enough?" We just took down an entire--~
@2009 = ~Arath?~
@2010 = ~...~
@2011 = ~Whatever it is, get over it. It doesn't matter. All that matters is that you have saved the grove, and for that we are thankful.~
@2012 = ~To you, <CHARNAME>, we also owe our thanks. A blessing on you and yours, to help you on your way.~
@2013 = ~That done, I think it's about time we returned. You're welcome to join us, if you wish, Arath.~
@2014 = ~I... I owe my loyalty to <CHARNAME>. <PRO_HESHE> has earned it.~
@2015 = ~As you will. Best of luck with whatever it is you're doing. Do stop by sometime.~
@2016 = ~I will. Goodbye, Ellen.~
@2017 = ~Take care of yourself.~
@2018 = ~Yeah.~
@2019 = ~Mining for Trouble

We cleared out the mine and in exchange, received a blessing from Archdruid Wreimass. Bylanna would probably like to be informed.~
@2020 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. You didn't have to help me, but you did, and I appreciate that. Really.~
@2021 = ~Come on. I'm sure we've got better things to do than get bitten by flies.~
@2022 = ~We should have killed him.~
@2023 = ~Who should we have killed?~
@2024 = ~What are you talking about?~
@2025 = ~The slaver? Haftmund?~
@2026 = ~Snap out of it, Arath. I need you here, not in your head.~
@2027 = ~I don't have time for this. Stop being a child.~
@2028 = ~The slaver. Haftmund. We should have killed him.~
@2029 = ~Then make time for it! I'm tired of you not listening to me!~
@2030 = ~You know what? Forget it. I don't care. Whatever.~
@2031 = ~He was just lying to save his own damned skin. There's no way my father planned to destroy the slavers. He was the one who made them powerful in Athkatla in the first place.~
@2032 = ~Maybe he had a change of heart.~
@2033 = ~People will say anything to avoid death. Don't worry about it.~
@2034 = ~Maybe Haftmund was lying. Maybe he wasn't. Does it matter?~
@2035 = ~It sounds like you're trying to convince yourself, not me.~
@2036 = ~I really don't know what to believe anymore.~
@2037 = ~Anyway. Thanks. You didn't have to help me, but you did. I appreciate it.~
@2038 = ~Of course. Any time.~
@2039 = ~No, I didn't have to help you.~
@2040 = ~You certainly don't seem very appreciative.~
@2041 = ~Can we get going? We've got business to attend to.~
@2042 = ~No, you didn't.~
@2043 = ~Thanks.~
@2044 = ~I am. I just... I've got a lot on my mind.~
@2045 = ~You're right. Let's continue.~
@2046 = ~If you don't mind, I'd rather not talk much. We can just walk. If you want to.~
@2047 = ~<CHARNAME>? You got a minute?~
@2048 = ~Of course. What is it?~
@2049 = ~Well, I don't have any on me, but...~
@2050 = ~Very funny. You know what I meant.~
@2051 = ~Yeah. I guess it is.~
@2052 = ~I just wanted to thank you. For helping me with the slavers. Again.~
@2053 = ~It's a good thing we did.~
@2054 = ~It was. And it was my pleasure. Any time.~
@2055 = ~Anything involving you and chains, and I'm in.~
@2056 = ~We saved an entire grove, and all we got was a stupid blessing. I'm not happy.~
@2057 = ~Right. Well, we've got business to attend to.~
@2058 = ~Heh. I'll keep that in mind.~
@2059 = ~Not many people are honoured with an Archdruid's blessing, you know. Most people would be proud.~
@2060 = ~But I suppose I should know better. You *are* <CHARNAME>, after all.~
@2061 = ~You're right. Let's get going.~
@2062 = ~I just... I keep thinking back over what happened. What Haftmund said. I don't regret killing him--the bastard deserved to die--but...~
@2063 = ~You wish you found out what he had to say?~
@2064 = ~You should have made his death far more drawn out, if you ask me.~
@2065 = ~It's not worth agonising over. It's in the past.~
@2066 = ~Snap out of it, Arath. You need to come back to the real world.~
@2067 = ~I just wonder...~
@2068 = ~Anyway.~
@2069 = ~You're right. I know that. Still...~
@2070 = ~I know. Don't worry about it.~
@2071 = ~Let's get going. We've got a lot yet to do, and not much time to do it in.~

@2100    = ~Have you changed your mind? There are women and children in captivity there, <CHARNAME>. These slavers need to be taken out.~
@2101    = ~Agreed. Join me and we'll do it now.~
@2102    = ~I'm still too busy.~
@2103    = ~Another time.~
@2104    = ~We should get going. The sooner we can get this done the better.~
@2105    = ~Well, let me know. It's not like they're slaves or anything.~
@2106    = ~Nice to see you again, my fair <CHARNAME>! Are you in need of my services, or is this just a courtesy call to see how I'm doing?~
@2107    = ~I would be glad to have you join us.~
@2108    = ~Just a courtesy call, I'm afraid.~
@2109    = ~I have to go.~
@2110   = ~So where to, heroic leader?~
@2111   = ~Ah. Well, I'm fine, the Coronet is treating me well, though I am thinking about travelling back to my grove for a while. I suppose we'll see.~
@2112   = ~Good to see you.~
@2113   = ~You want me to leave? I mean, I understand, but hey, if it's something I did you'd tell me, right?~
@2114   = ~Don't worry, I just need you to head back to the Coronet for a while.~
@2115   = ~Can you wait here?~
@2116   = ~My mistake, sorry.~
@2117   = ~Sure thing, boss. Just come and get me if you need me.~
@2118   = ~Sure thing, boss. Just come and get me when you need me to rejoin.~
@2119   = ~Shall we continue?~
@2120   = ~What... what happened? <CHARNAME>? Where are we? Why does my head ache? Ugh... I feel like I'm going to be sick.~
@2121   = ~Bodhi turned you into a vampire. I brought you back.~
@2122   = ~You were a vampire for a little while, and then you died, so that's probably not surprising.~
@2123   = ~You don't remember anything?~
@2124   = ~Well, toughen up, princess. We have things to do.~
@2125   = ~Oh, gods. Now I remember. No wonder I feel sick... she bit me! I probably have some awful disease, now. Vampire rabies or something.~
@2126   = ~This... this is going to take a little while to process. How do you reverse vampirism? I thought it was impossible?~
@2127   = ~Don't worry about it. What matters is that you're safe.~
@2128   = ~With the help of a book, Bodhi's heart and a long dead god.~
@2129   = ~It was... complicated. Something to do with Amaunator, anyway.~
@2130   = ~I had some help. Come on, let's get going.~
@2131   = ~I suppose. I would have preferred it if I was safe in the first place, but...~
@2132   = ~Sounds fun. Wish I could have been there to help, heh.~
@2133   = ~Thank you. Though I'm not sure "thank you" is really sufficient here. I'll make sure you get thoroughly rewarded later... somewhere a little more private.~
@2134   = ~(wince) As soon as I recover enough, anyway. I really don't feel great.~
@2135   = ~I take it you killed the bitch?~
@2136   = ~Staked her twice just to make sure she was dead, don't worry.~
@2137   = ~Actually, we sort of... hit it off. Went out to dinner a few times. We're getting married next summer.~
@2138   = ~Of course. I couldn't let her vampirise you and then leave her to her own devices now, could I?~
@2139   = ~She was already dead, but yeah, I killed her again.~
@2140   = ~Good. You probably could have staked her three times, but I trust you.~
@2141   = ~Well, you could have, but I probably wouldn't have been very happy about it.~
@2142   = ~Good. She really deserves to be killed again, but... I suppose twice will have to do.~
@2143   = ~(grin) As long as I'm invited and get to be best man, I'm happy.~
@2144   = ~Alright, let's get going.~
@2145   = ~As soon as I regain feeling in my legs, anyway. Ugh. Remind me not to get vampirized again.~
@2148   = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

While I had feared for some time that Bodhi's final revenge on me would be to take away Arath forever, it seems that the information in the lorebook was right...  Amaunator's idol has restored Arath not only to life, but has removed the vampiric curse from him, as well.~
@2149   = ~Took you long enough. Let's go talk to the Archdruid.~
@2150   = ~I'll handle this. You wait here, I'll come and get you when we're done.~
@2151   = ~Sounds like a plan to me.~
@2152   = ~I'm not interested in whatever he wants. I need you to come back with me.~
@2153   = ~I mean no offense to you, dear <CHARNAME>, but he wants to talk to me, not you.~
@2154   = ~Alright, join up and we'll go.~
@2155   = ~I don't have room for you right now.~
@2156   = ~Then you can do this on your own.~
@2157   = ~Then let's go see what Her Naturalness requires of me today. (sigh)~
@2158   = ~Sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I can't do that. I have to sort this out, whatever it is. It's my duty. Now you can either help me, or leave me to do it myself. Your choice.~
@2159   = ~Then make room and come back. This is important.~
@2160   = ~Fine. I'll be here if you change your mind.~
